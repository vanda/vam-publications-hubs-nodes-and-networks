Less research has centred on the back-of-house elements that have enabled creative individuals to develop their work. One such element are the meeting spaces for artistic communities, which have always been fundamental to their development. Historic examples include the nightclub Cabaret Voltaire, in Zurich, which was pivotal for Dada in the 1910s, and the writer Gertrude Stein’s Parisian apartment, a key place for Modernism in Europe during the first half of the twentieth century. This research project, titled <em>Hubs, Nodes and Networks: A New History of British Digital Art,</em> re-examines the relevance of such spaces to the fostering of computational and digital art in contemporary culture, as well as the people behind them, with the aim of representing the collective effort that has enabled this field of art to succeed.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-01-norma-tamburini\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_01_norma_tamburini\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Computer-generated print on paper showing eight diagonal lines formed of shorter vertical lines of varying length \" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_01_norma_tamburini.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Norma Tamburini, Untitled, c. 1968, computer generated print on paper, 108 x 30 cm.

The project reviews the development of digital art in the United Kingdom from the 1960s to the present day, focusing on three main elements that have contributed to the formation of a thriving digital art ecology in the region: artistic hubs, nodes and networks. In the context of this project, ‘hubs’ have been defined as localities that could be physical or digital, permanent or temporal, where individuals gather; ‘nodes’ are individuals who produce connections and might be affiliated with certain hubs or networks; and ‘networks’ are the communities, declared or loosely correlated, that sit across the hubs and nodes. Additionally, the research considers as a baseline the V&amp;A’s Computer Arts Society (CAS) Archive and Collection (1968–85) – a key resource to understanding in depth the 1960s beginnings of digital art in the UK and abroad. A major significance of the archive and collection lies in the overview they provide of the global networks that the society held with other international communities, exploring the use of computers in creative practice and how knowledge was exchanged in a pre-internet era. Finding this type of notable content was what inspired the project and drove an interest in reflecting on the contemporary history of artistic networks within the field of digital art.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-02-poster-cybernetic\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_02_poster_cybernetic\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Promotional poster of the exhibition ‘Cybernetic Serendipity’ showcasing a robot and a geometrical composition alongside the list of participants\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_02_poster_cybernetic.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Poster of ‘Cybernetic Serendipity’ exhibition, Institute of Contemporary Arts, London (2 August — 20 October 1968).

Reichardt’s exhibition demonstrated through the work of 130 artists and scientists how post-war technologies could be applied for creative purposes. Both Mallen and Sutcliffe were part of the show. Mallen worked with the cybernetician Gordon Pask to produce the work <em>The Colloquy of Mobiles</em> (1968), while Sutcliffe took part with the composer Peter Zinovieff and the Electronic Music Studios (EMS). The first iteration of CAS, which is represented by the V&amp;A’s holdings, was active from 1968 to ‘85 and developed workshops, events and regular gatherings, in addition to generating exchange through its <em>PAGE</em> bulletin, where international exhibitions, events, resources, news, reviews and articles were published and distributed to its members. By 1974, the society had 192 members including the writer and systems engineer Jonathan Benthall, cybernetic sculptor Edward Ihnatowicz and Jasia Reichardt. Key to CAS’s global reach were the networks based at Centro de Arte y Comunicación (CAYC) (Buenos Aires), the New Tendencies Group (Zagreb) and the group Experiments with Art and Technology (E.A.T.) at Bell Laboratories (New Jersey). These groups are represented in the V&amp;A’s collection through the work of such artists as Eduardo Mac Entyre, Norma Tamburini, Marc Adrian, A. Michael Noll and Lillian Schwartz.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-03-peter-zinovieff\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_03_peter_zinovieff\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Technological equipment from Peter Zinovieff's electronic music studio staged at the exhibition ‘Cybernetic Serendipity’\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_03_peter_zinovieff.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Peter Zinovieff’s Studio at the ‘Cybernetic Serendipity’ exhibition, Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, (2 August — 20 October 1968)</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">© Cybernetic Serendipity 1968 </span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Technological equipment from Peter Zinovieff's electronic music studio staged at the exhibition ‘Cybernetic Serendipity’\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_03_peter_zinovieff.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Peter Zinovieff’s Studio at the ‘Cybernetic Serendipity’ exhibition, Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, (2 August — 20 October 1968)</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">© Cybernetic Serendipity 1968 </span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<figure id=\"image-04-gordon-pask\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_04_gordon_pask\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Interactive installation with five computer-controlled fiberglass sculptural mobiles presented at the exhibition ‘Cybernetic Serendipity’\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_04_gordon_pask.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Gordon Pask, Colloquy of Mobiles, 1968.

This methodology includes conducting primary research in the V&amp;A’s CAS Archive and Collection as well as in the Tate archives, ZKM | Center for Art and Media archives and the personal archive of Jasia Reichardt. The V&amp;A’s archive is composed of 29 boxes. In addition to material related to CAS activities, the archive contains memorabilia from international exhibitions and events, John Lansdown and George Mallen’s correspondence, newspaper cut-outs, magazines, artist sketches and texts, and technological brochures. Tate’s and the ZKM’s holdings expand on certain artists, while Reichardt’s tracks her curatorial interactions with many key figures in the field, both in the UK and overseas. Research also included oral interviews with five artists (1960s to ‘80s) whose stories are interwoven with that of CAS and represented in the V&amp;A’s archive, including Analivia Cordeiro, Ernest Edmonds, William Latham, John Lifton and Stephen Willats. These extended conversations were complemented by a programme of structured interviews with representatives of the 1990s to 2020s that featured qualitative and quantitative questions and were carried out in a combination of digital surveys and direct interviews. In this component, 16 artists and curators that have contributed to the formation of the UK’s contemporary digital art landscape were featured, including Heath Bunting, Ruth Catlow (Furtherfield), Alison Craighead (Thomson &amp; Craighead), Sofia Crespo, Nina Davies, Marc Garrett (Furtherfield), Libby Heaney, Zaiba Jabbar (Hervisions), Keiken, Lawrence Lek, Irini Papadimitriou, Anna Ridler, Erica Scourti, Jon Thompson (Thomson &amp; Craighead), Nye Thompson, and Kay Watson (Serpentine Galleries). Data from the archives and the interviews was identified, compiled and categorized in a data set to determine which types of events and networks have enabled the formation of digital art in the UK. The purpose of understanding the history of digital art in this way is to track and map directly from the data the relationships between individuals and organisations. These data points were systematically organized according to the roles of individuals (e.g. artist, composer, curator), their networks and work media (e.g. film, performance). An initial visualisation model was then constructed with Dr Jin Gao, Lecturer in Digital Archives, and Dr Bonnie Buyuklieva, Lecturer in Data Science for Society, both from the Department of Information Studies at University College London. This way of mapping information links the subject further to its conceptual framework on global nodal connectivity and offers a new way of reading art history.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-05-event-one\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_05_event_one\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Invitation to ‘Event One’ organised by the Computer Arts Society at the Royal College of Art advertising demos, talks and workshops, alongside arts mediums such as film, drama, graphics, sculpture, dance, light, music and poetry\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_05_event_one.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Invitation to ‘Event One’, Royal College of Art, London, 1969</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Courtesy of the Computer Arts Society </span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Invitation to ‘Event One’ organised by the Computer Arts Society at the Royal College of Art advertising demos, talks and workshops, alongside arts mediums such as film, drama, graphics, sculpture, dance, light, music and poetry\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_05_event_one.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Invitation to ‘Event One’, Royal College of Art, London, 1969</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Courtesy of the Computer Arts Society </span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>The first prototype of the data-visualization model addresses the period from the 1960s to the ‘80s, when CAS was active. This model reveals the key geographical locations in the UK where international exchange was taking place during this period. It also highlights the types of practice that artists were focusing on and features the individuals that created the global networks. Beyond this, the model allows us to track the development of artistic networks in the UK. This data-based reading of digital art provides an alternative context to the traditional art historical canon that presents artists as individual geniuses and encourages one to recognize instead the interdependencies of artistic practices. Moreover, it is an interactive data-visualization model, making art history a more tactile matter. The next step in this model is to chart the relationships between practitioners of early generations to artists of the 1990s to the 2020s. A continued enquiry of this type into the present might help to show connections between the period of computational art which is covered here and the contemporary period that this project is yet to map.</p>\n<p>This research project was developed between January 2023 and June 2024 at the V&amp;A with the support of the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-06-interactive-prototype\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_06_interactive_prototype\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Interactive prototype of a data visualisation model demonstrating the Computer Arts Society’s global network from 1968 to 1985\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_06_interactive_prototype.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Still image of interactive prototype network visualisation of the individuals in the Computer Arts Society (1968 - 1985), constructed based on individual’s common attributes, colour-coded with the regions they were based in.

At only 19 years old, Cordeiro programmed the computer dance <em>M3X3</em> (1973) which was presented for the first time at the ‘INTERACT. Man: Machine: Society’ exhibition and conference, organized by the Computer Arts Society for the Edinburgh International Festival. This work and supporting materials are part of the V&amp;A’s Digital Art Collection.</p>\n<p><strong>Pita Arreola:</strong> Reflecting on the beginning of your career, could you elaborate on your earliest encounters with computer art and how you came to incorporate certain methodologies and technologies into your practice?</p>\n<p><strong>Analivia Cordeiro:</strong> When I presented my work <em>M3x3</em> in 1973, I was only 19 years old. I did not have any formal training or academic links to the field of technology. I learned how to program computers through books. More importantly, I was a professional dancer. I have been dancing since I was seven years old. This has given me a complex understanding of the vocabulary and language of body movements.</p>\n<p>In 1973, my life radically changed when my father, the artist Waldemar Cordeiro, passed away unexpectedly in his sleep at the age of 48. But I continued my work and in August that year, I premiered <em>M3x3</em> at the ‘INTERACT. Man: Machine: Society’* exhibition and conference which was part of the Edinburgh International Festival. I did not attend the event, but I sent the film by post with the paper 'A Language for Dance’ (1973) which is part of the V&amp;A collection. The architect John Lansdown presented the paper and the film on my behalf at the conference.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-01-analivia-cordeiro\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_01_analivia_cordeiro\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Still from video featuring nine dancers performing a computer-generated choreography The dancers wear black customes with white lines against a white background with black lines\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_01_analivia_cordeiro.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Analivia Cordeiro.

It was an interesting experience because I was by far the youngest person attending. I met the artist John Whitney who was 72 at that time and became friends with the artist Herbert Franke. His English was not good and mine was worse, but we developed a nice friendship. When I came back to Brazil, we exchanged letters, and communicating by post took months of course.</p>\n<p>I also had a very good relationship with the cybernetician Gordon Pask. He was a very intelligent person with a flexible mind. I had dinner at his house, and we talked about education. I only met John Lansdown once and we did not have the time to discuss culture, but in 1977 he wrote a paper about computers and choreography, and he mentioned my practice as an example of pioneering work.**</p>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> Since early on in your career, you have taken part in different events and exhibitions such as ‘INTERACT. Machine: Man: Society’ (1973), organized by the Computer Arts Society (CAS) for the Edinburgh International Festival; the ‘Latin America 74’ exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA), London (1973); and the ‘Art and Science’ programme at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, Jerusalem (1974). Could you tell us about these and other events that were both memorable and important in establishing the circle that your practice originates from, or that further raised the profile of your community of practice?</p>\n<p><strong>AC:</strong> I was somewhat isolated in Brazil. I had little money after my father’s death, so I couldn’t travel much. I travelled intellectually, but not physically. But in a way, I had many freedoms in my work because I was not connected to a university or company.</p>\n<p>Those exhibitions, especially ‘INTERACT. Machine: Man: Society’<em>,</em> were fundamental for my career. I was very young when I sent my proposal to CAS, but they accepted it and sent me an invitation to be part of the exhibition by post. I took the letter to the broadcaster TV Cultura in Brazil and asked them for support. The director was astonished that I had received an invitation to present my work at an international arts festival. It took some convincing, but she agreed to speak to the committee and after 10 days they confirmed their support. Without Lansdown and the exhibition, I would have never been able to develop <em>M3x3</em>.</p>\n<p>For the recording of this video, a computer generated the instructions to assemble the scenes, so the TV director did not have much work to do. The dancers were aware of how to direct their movements towards the cameras positioned at the front, top and sides of the stage. For the final edition, I asked them to use a high contrast of black and white, so the images could aesthetically respond to computer binaries, 0s and 1s, as well as merge the body with the scene. They were reluctant at first, but they ended up accepting my request.</p>\n<p>After that, I met Jorge Glusberg, director of Centro de Arte y Comunicación (CAyC), in Buenos Aires. He selected the work of artists, including mine, and presented it in New York and across Europe in countries like Italy, Belgium and France, and in London at the ICA. These exhibitions raised awareness of the exchanges between art and technology and presented the aesthetic propositions of a collective of artists. CAS and CAyC cemented the foundations of today’s digital art practices. I was very lucky to be part of those groups.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-02-analivia-cordeiro\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_02_analivia_cordeiro\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Close up of five dancers performing a computer-generated choreography The dancers wear black customes with white lines against a white background with black lines\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_02_analivia_cordeiro.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Analivia Cordeiro.

It would be good to hear about that, considering how terminologies have been used and changed across different periods.</p>\n<p><strong>AC:</strong> At the beginning there were two main terms: ‘computer art’ and ‘computer-aided art’. Computer art applied to works where the output was directly generated by the computer, like a plotter drawing. Computer-aided art described work where the computer produced the instructions for humans to translate and execute. In this type of art form, the final artwork is the human interpretation. Over time, the latter term disappeared; we don’t have a distinction any more between computer- and human-decoded outputs.</p>\n<p>My work also included video, which fell under ‘multimedia art’, a term that came after ‘computer art’. Gradually, the whole movement evolved into a moment when it was called ‘art and technology’. Nowadays, everybody uses technology. The term ‘digital’ sits in opposition to ‘analogue’, and at this point in time the analogue seems Palaeolithic and has disappeared. ‘Digital art’ emerges from computer art and should be used to describe artists who are really questioning the relationship between humans and technology. Using digital tools is not enough anymore. We are now immersed in technology and unable to experience reality without technology.</p>\n<p>Additionally, our visual capacity changes over time. It relies on the stimuli we receive and our physiology. We see things differently than we used to see them last century. Today, there are two prominent phenomena that contemporary art should address. The first is the constancy of change, and the second is the excessive abundance of visual imagery. In my view, what matters today is not the individual artwork, but the visual structure that it proposes. ‘Generative art’ produces thousands of examples of the same visual structure, and each example is a variation of this structure. In this type of work, the audience’s role shifts from selecting a specific artwork to rationally understanding the visual structure because it is very difficult to choose one image since they all seem similar, but each one is different from the other. The images appear similar but they are never the same.</p>\n<p>Digital art is no longer sufficient to address this type of art, and it could be called instead ‘post-digital art’ which could also be described as ‘probabilistic’ or ‘structural digital art’. Probability here refers to rapid and constant change. This attitude can be defined as a ‘quantum posture’, where things are in continuous flux, passing through a position for a fraction of a second and we are only able to perceive and experience their constant change. To create work in this context means that images are constantly being generated and their physical representation is the structure in time. Because of this, time is central to the concept of structural art. I’m trying to explain here what will be implicit in future works of art that will originate from ‘computer art’ that existed 60 years ago.</p>\n<p>Future spectators will be challenged to understand and visually absorb this structure, but visualisation is changing, and we will change. People will need more accuracy to understand and memorize similar images.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-03-analivia-cordeiro\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_03_analivia_cordeiro\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Diagram with 54 drawings of body position notations for the computer-generated dance 0º⟺45º  \" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_03_analivia_cordeiro.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Analivia Cordeiro. 0º⟺45º dance notation, 1974-1984, computer plotter output on paper, 21.5 x 33.2 cm </span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">© Analivia Cordeiro</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Diagram with 54 drawings of body position notations for the computer-generated dance 0º⟺45º  \" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_03_analivia_cordeiro.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Analivia Cordeiro. 0º⟺45º dance notation, 1974-1984, computer plotter output on paper, 21.5 x 33.2 cm </span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">© Analivia Cordeiro</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> Over the years, you have collaborated with different individuals across the UK and internationally, including Vladimir Bonačić, John Lansdown and Nilton Lobo. Could you tell us about these collaborations and the expertise they have brought to your practice?</p>\n<p><strong>AC:</strong> As I mentioned, Lansdown was fundamental: his invitation to ‘INTERACT’ and the collaboration that generated was what brought me into this world. Before him, I met Bonačić. He came to Brazil in 1971 for the exhibition ‘Arteônica’ that my father organized in São Paulo. I was then a first-year student at the Architecture and Urbanism College at the University of São Paulo. During his visit, I showed him mathematical visual studies that I had done utilizing lines and dots. He then introduced me to the concept of random choice which was shaping the aesthetic of that moment and was very important for programming my work. These ideas helped me consider how to program my choreographies defining the different body positions.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-04-vladimir-bonacic\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_04_vladimir_bonacic\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Square shaped computer-based light installation with 256 yellow light bulbs that activate intermediately in response to a programmed sequence\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_04_vladimir_bonacic.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Vladimir Bonačić.

After that, I came back to Brazil and developed the second phase of my work dedicated to the notation of movement. It is unbelievable but still today there is not an established efficient and easy method to write movements like we have with music. Over the years, dance history has been lost because of this reason. At that point, I was looking for a collaborator and went to the University of São Paulo. In January 1983, the director of the Computer Science Department introduced me to the engineer Nilton Lobo. We began our collaboration, and we got married in 1993. We now have a son who is part of our family research unit.</p>\n<p>The first thing that I have to say is that I consider Nilton a co-author, because technical experts not only support the work, but they also shape the work with their perspective. They give the work future possibilities. I believe all artists should consider technicians as co-authors.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-05-analivia-cordeiro\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_05_analivia_cordeiro\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Artist Analivia Cordeiro smiling, seated at a workstation with two computer monitors, a keyboard and a mouse, in São Paulo\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_05_analivia_cordeiro.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Analivia Cordeiro working at Intergraph InterAct Workstation, São Paulo, 1984</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">© Analivia Cordeiro</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Artist Analivia Cordeiro smiling, seated at a workstation with two computer monitors, a keyboard and a mouse, in São Paulo\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_05_analivia_cordeiro.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Analivia Cordeiro working at Intergraph InterAct Workstation, São Paulo, 1984</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">© Analivia Cordeiro</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<figure id=\"image-06-nilton-lobo\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_06_nilton_lobo\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Engineer Nilton Lobo typing while seated at a workstation with two computer monitors, a keyboard and a mouse, in São Paulo\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_06_nilton_lobo.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Nilton Lobo working at Intergraph InterAct Workstation, São Paulo, 1984</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">© Analivia Cordeiro</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Engineer Nilton Lobo typing while seated at a workstation with two computer monitors, a keyboard and a mouse, in São Paulo\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_06_nilton_lobo.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Nilton Lobo working at Intergraph InterAct Workstation, São Paulo, 1984</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">© Analivia Cordeiro</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>In the beginning, I had a vision of programming human movement into the computer. The work we have done is pioneering motion capture, as there was nothing available to do this before. To be a pioneer means that you find ways to transform ideas that do not exist into reality. Through our research on trajectory notation, I studied the single frames of a film and identified 24 joints of the body’s limbs per frame. The video contained 30 frames per second and this exercise produced thousands of body movements. Nilton made the program that transformed that information into 2D figures that we used to generate 3D computer figures. This whole process resulted in a motion-capture system called Nota-Anna.</p>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong>  Beyond networks of digital art that we’ve mentioned, you’ve also circulated amongst communities of dance. Could you tell us about how these differ or what they bring?</p>\n<p><strong>AC:</strong> I have always considered myself a dancer. Dance communities are very distinct from others because we have a strict lifestyle. To be a dancer is like being an athlete. We are very disciplined. We are not able to go out at night and get drunk, because the next morning we cannot work well.</p>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> As a practitioner with expertise in the fields of algorithmic choreography and architecture of movement, could you outline some of the key technologies and tools that have made your practice possible?</p>\n<p><strong>AC:</strong> I mostly use video in my work. At the beginning, I did not have a plotter, so I drew by hand the six numbers of a vector that represent the body position in the printed output of the computer dance. I used plotters when they became available. Then later, the operating system Windows, which I found to be great because you could store different information and it gave you the ability to multitask. The internet changed everything and gave us the opportunity to communicate with more people. When video was integrated into the internet, the space became a paradise.</p>\n<p>In terms of software, Photoshop created great freedom and QuickTime allowed the editing process in video to become home-made. These technological tools empowered individuals but people have become slaves to the technology. I am not driven by technology. I use it when it makes sense to me. I have incorporated all the new technologies into my work because it made the research easier and because of the possibilities it opened to develop our first dream of finding a way to write and create movement. Today, the challenge for people is to find a personal space that allows them to express themselves. Technology obliges us to follow too many rules to communicate, we should have more space to find our personal way of communicating.</p>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> It would be interesting to hear about the thinkers and theoretical concepts that have helped shape your work.</p>\n<p><strong>AC:</strong> Historically, Brazil was not a technology driven country, but I had my father. When he was alive, he gave me access to information and books about computer art and theorists like the engineer and philosopher Abraham Moles. These ideas provided me with a clear direction to understand technological contexts and my place within them. Another theorist is Jonathan Benthall from the ICA, London, who had a very unique and humanistic perspective about technology and culture. His book <em>Science and Technology in Art Today</em> (1972) was very influential for the field.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-07-waldemar-cordeiro\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_07_waldemar_cordeiro\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Computer-generated portrait on paper of a female and male character facing each other\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_07_waldemar_cordeiro.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Waldemar Cordeiro, Derivadas de uma Imagem: Transformação em Grau Zero, 1969, litograph after a computer-generated impact print, 61 x 44.5 cm.

Laban was a theoretician who analyzed the language of human body movement through its elements and established the relationship between those elements. He was very important to my work, because this method allowed me to understand body movements in order to program them on the computer.</p>\n<p>Another influential figure was the artist, designer and choreographer Oskar Schlemmer, who was a tutor at the Bauhaus. I love his work. One day, Mrs Duschenes took us to see the film of his <em>Triadic Ballet</em> from 1922 at the Goethe Institut, in São Paulo, and I started intuitively learning from his work by dancing and imitating the movement of his dancers. When I was 12, I also met the artist John Cage, and Merce Cunningham. These artistic experiences and my research drove me to seek new aesthetics. I think that a new media requires a new aesthetic. You can see these new languages of video and body movements in my three videos <em>M3x3</em>, <em>0=45°</em> (1974)* and <em>Cambiantes</em> (1976).</p>\n<figure id=\"image-08-kinetic-spectacle\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_08_kinetic_spectacle\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Five dancers performing a contemporary choreography in a dance concert at Museu de Arte Moderna de Campinas, São Paulo\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_08_kinetic_spectacle.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Espectáculo Cinético (Kinetic Spectacle), 1969, dance concert with Maria Duschenes group, Museu de Arte Moderna de Campinas, São Paulo, black and white photograph</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Photo: Abrāo Metri</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Five dancers performing a contemporary choreography in a dance concert at Museu de Arte Moderna de Campinas, São Paulo\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_08_kinetic_spectacle.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Espectáculo Cinético (Kinetic Spectacle), 1969, dance concert with Maria Duschenes group, Museu de Arte Moderna de Campinas, São Paulo, black and white photograph</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Photo: Abrāo Metri</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> Finally, could you speak about the conceptual framework of your work and how it has evolved over the years?</p>\n<p><strong>AC:</strong> The goal of computer art in the 1970s was to establish a dialogue between technology and society. Computers represented a bright future for a new society that would be more egalitarian, with people having more free time. It is not exactly what happened, or is not our reality today, but the energy was very positive. Artists were trying to understand how to translate the language of arts into a computer. In my case, I was looking for ways to translate elements of choreography and body expression so these could be programmed by a computer. Nowadays, we have the opposite problem, we need to take people’s activities away from computers.</p>\n<p>Artists were part of a counter-culture movement and many questions that emerged during that time are still relevant and unresolved today. Counter-culture was very important, and it is something that the group exhibition ‘Coded: Art Enters the Computer Age’ (2023) at Los Angeles County Museum of Art showcased very successfully. This movement was killed by big corporations like IBM and Siemens who started to pay artists to create with their products.</p>\n<p>At first glance, you can think that I was trying to solve practical problems of how to coordinate the video camera with human movement in dance production. That was one of the objectives of my early research, but the second phase focused on how to write body movements. Behind these practical problems there is deeper research concerning the future of humans and the behaviour of humans with technology. In <em>M3x3</em> I approached this question by establishing body positions through notational figures. The dancers then learnt the positions and created the link between the positions in order to produce the choreography. In this way, the dancers were emotionally involved by making individual decisions on the movements and could express themselves creating the transitions between positions. I never saw the dancer in this process as an animation or an avatar.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-09-analivia-cordeiro\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_09_analivia_cordeiro\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Diagram with 140 drawings of body position notations for the computer-generated dance M3x3  \" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_09_analivia_cordeiro.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Analivia Cordeiro.

For example, today you must fit all your messages inside the rectangular shape of screens, otherwise you lose them. This is a big limitation for our brain. If I owned a technology company, I would invent and distribute screens in round, square and polygonal shapes, so people could be freer to feed their ideas to the screen.</p>\n<p>Another element that is important to my work is spontaneity: I always propose to people to act as they feel in their own time, which gives them the freedom to find their own possibilities. This idea was presented in my show ‘From Body to Code’ (2023) at ZKM (Center for Art and Media, Karlsruhe) where we had motion-capture works that proposed to people ways to find their own pace and movements.</p>\n<p>A final element of my work is the relationship between humans and their surroundings. In my first work <em>M3x3</em>, I merged the human body with the scene as a way to signify that we are one with nature. This is an idea that I applied to succeeding artworks. Through my work, I invite the audience not to oppose the environment but to work with it. Some people destroy the environment for profit, but there is a limit to what money can provide if we don’t have a proper natural world.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-10-analivia-cordeiro\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_10_analivia_cordeiro\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Two people dancing to the projection of Analivia Cordeiro’s computer-generated dance Cambiantes at her exhibition ‘Body to Code’ in ZKM | Center for Art and Media, Karlsruhe\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_10_analivia_cordeiro.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Analivia Cordeiro, Cambiantes installation, 1976-2015, three-channel video installation 4:3 (black and white, sound) at ‘Analivia Cordeiro: From Body to Code’ exhibition, ZKM | Center for Art and Media, Karlsruhe (28 January — 7 May 2023)</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Photo: Felix Grünschloß; Photo © ZKM | Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Two people dancing to the projection of Analivia Cordeiro’s computer-generated dance Cambiantes at her exhibition ‘Body to Code’ in ZKM | Center for Art and Media, Karlsruhe\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_10_analivia_cordeiro.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Analivia Cordeiro, Cambiantes installation, 1976-2015, three-channel video installation 4:3 (black and white, sound) at ‘Analivia Cordeiro: From Body to Code’ exhibition, ZKM | Center for Art and Media, Karlsruhe (28 January — 7 May 2023)</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Photo: Felix Grünschloß; Photo © ZKM | Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n","length":4227,"title":"Interview: Annalivia Cordeiro","type":"essay","url":"https://vanda.github.io/vam-publications-hubs-nodes-and-networks/interview-annalivia-cordeiro/"},{"content":"<p>Ernest Edmonds (b. 1942, United Kingdom) is an artist recognized as an early innovative figure of computer art. Underpinned by the Concrete and Constructivist traditions, his practice investigates how human perception and cognitive processes evolve over time within exchanges between humans and technological systems. Edmonds’ interactive work <em>Shaping Forms 14/07/2007</em> (2007) demonstrates these ideas and is part of the V&amp;A’s Digital Art Collection.</p>\n<p><strong>Pita Arreola:</strong> Reflecting on the beginning of your career, could you elaborate on your earliest encounters with computer art and how you came to incorporate certain methodologies and technologies into your practice?</p>\n<p><strong>Ernest Edmonds:</strong> I decided that I wanted to be an artist when I was a schoolboy, but the art schools of that day were not helpful for what I wanted to do. My friends that had gone to art school were not very enthusiastic about it. Long story short, I decided to do a mathematics degree which I found easy, so I had lots of time to paint. When I studied at the University of Leicester, the head of mathematics was a brilliant logician, so I got into logic. He introduced me to philosophy, and I ended up interested in the philosophy of mathematics and went to do a PhD in logic at the University of Nottingham, submitted in 1973. The branch of logic that I was concerned with was computation, so that helped me understand the logical underpinning of computer science and Alan Turing’s work.</p>\n<p>That is my background, but to answer your question, in 1967 I took a job as a research assistant in mathematics at what soon became the Leicester Polytechnic [now De Montfort University]. One year into my project, I noticed that we had a computer, so I decided to play with it and taught myself to program. I found that I could write programs to solve issues that were helpful for the research I was doing in logic. My research assistantship was uncertain as it had to be renewed yearly, and the head of the department told me about a lectureship in computing that would be a more permanent role, so I became a computer scientist by accident. I tried to do something that was interesting to me, and started applying computers to art and design. But in those days you could not say that you were doing computer art, because people would be dismissive, so I tried to label it all as ‘design support’.</p>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> Previously you commented on computer art having antecedents in other artistic movements, such as Constructivism and Concrete art. It would be good to hear your thoughts on that. I know, for example, that Constructivism has been very influential on your work and thinking.</p>\n<p><strong>EE:</strong> Without question,** I consider that the Constructivist tradition was really the artistic direction that led to what we are discussing now and if you read the writings of the people at the University of Stuttgart from the 1960s, you’ll see that this tradition was very influential. If we look at the UK scene in the 1940s, it turned out to be crucial because there was a group of artists before computers that were applying procedures to make their art. In particular, the artists Kenneth and Mary Martin and others around them. They devised the procedure that generated the art. The physical appearance of the artwork wasn’t something that the artist decided, the aesthetics emerged from decisions about the procedures. Kenneth once said to me that he wished he was younger because then he could have used computers.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-01-gillian-wise\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_01_gillian_wise\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Screenprint of a square composition featuring four colour and geometrical patterns on each corner against a backdrop of a larger sequence of the same pattern in grey\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_01_gillian_wise.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Gillian Wise, Red Quartet, 1974, screenprint with felt tip pen, 84.4 x 59.5 cm.

The ‘Systems’  exhibition (1972)  at Whitechapel Gallery, curated by Nicholas Serota, featured the work of the group and toured across the UK including to Leicester. These artists often used mathematics and geometry as the baseline for their work. The artists Malcolm Hughes and Jeffrey Steele were key in putting together the group. In a way, their work was directly leading towards using software for making art and it is important to note the vision</p>\n<p>they had. Jeffrey was lecturing at Portsmouth Polytechnic and proposed in the late 1960s buying a computer for the Art Department but failed to persuade them. However, a few years later, Malcolm succeeded in convincing the Slade School of Fine Art, in London, to buy a computer. Neither Malcolm nor Jeffrey were computer programmers, but they thought this was important for the future. Malcolm started the Experimental Department at the Slade in 1972.</p>\n<p>During the 1960s, there were many events across the world that catalyzed the use of computers in the arts. In 1965, the mathematician George Nees and computer scientist Frieder Nake presented their computer art in the exhibition ‘computer grafik’ at the University of Stuttgart. That year, the Howard Wise Gallery in New York showed the work of the neuroscientist Béla Julesz and engineer A. Michael Noll in the exhibition ‘Computer-Generated Pictures’. From the UK point of view, Jasia Reichardt organized the *‘*Cybernetic Serendipity’ show at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London during 1968. Before that, she had met the philosopher Max Bense who taught at the University of Stuttgart, and proposed that the future were computers. The Computer Arts Society (CAS) was also formed in August that year.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-02-frieder-nake\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_02_frieder_nake\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Computer-generated drawing on paper displaying a square grid that contains an uneven arrangement of circles and horizontal and vertical lines that appear to be hand drawn in the style of artist Paul Klee\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_02_frieder_nake.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Frieder Nake, Hommage à Paul Klee, 1965, screenprint on paper, from a computer-generated drawing, 49.2 x 49.2 cm.

By abstractions, I mean using elements like landscapes or flowers, whereas in the abstract work, I was interested in more geometric and minimalistic forms of the Constructivist tradition. In 1968, I had just taught myself how to write computer programs. I decided to make an artwork that summarized what I had been doing in the previous ten years. The work is titled <em>Nineteen</em> (1968–9) and it is composed of 20 square reliefs. I was finding it difficult to decide how to arrange the composition. I realized that I could write down the rules and use them to write a computer program to work out the arrangement. It turned out that it was practically difficult to do this, because Leicester Polytechnic only had one computer. But I managed to get three hours with the computer to run my program and find a solution.</p>\n<p>I wanted to use spray paint to apply colour in my compositions to avoid brush marks. I was looking for help to do this and crossed the road to the Art Department where I found the artist Stroud Cornock in charge of a spray booth. He helped me with the painting but he was more interested in the fact that I was using a computer program to work out the compositional arrangement. He had previously been working with the artist Roy Ascott and was inspired by these new technologies. After that, we became good friends and collaborators.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-04-ernest-edmonds\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_04_ernest_edmonds\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Set of 20 sculptural squares mounted on a wall with variable colourful geometric motifs composed utilising a computer program\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_04_ernest_edmonds.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Ernest Edmonds, Nineteen, 1968-69, computer generated composition, mixed media, 170 x 135 x 15cm</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Photo: Jules Lister © Ernest Edmonds</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Set of 20 sculptural squares mounted on a wall with variable colourful geometric motifs composed utilising a computer program\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_04_ernest_edmonds.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Ernest Edmonds, Nineteen, 1968-69, computer generated composition, mixed media, 170 x 135 x 15cm</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Photo: Jules Lister © Ernest Edmonds</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> I know you worked with Stroud Cornock on several projects, including <em>DataPack</em> (1970). Could you tell us about this collaboration and the development it brought to your practice?</p>\n<p><strong>EE:</strong> In 1969, Stroud and I wrote the paper ‘The Creative Process Where the Artist is Amplified or Superseded by the Computer’<em>,</em> which we saw as a manifesto. We presented it in 1970 and it was published in the journal <em>Leonardo</em> in 1973. One of our key points was that the future of art with computers would be interactive. This was before the personal computer. That year, 1970, we had the opportunity to show <em>DataPack</em> in the ‘Computer Graphics 70’ exhibition. They hosted the show alongside the conference, and we thought it would be an ideal space to present the type of interactive artwork we proposed in our paper presented at that conference. We designed and built the piece. It would not look too exciting today, but it was what was possible with the technology of that time. It demonstrated the potential of interactive art where you turned the audience into a participatory element of the creative process and gave them agency to influence the work. <em>DataPack</em> used a teletype allowing typed data to be sent to a computer. The participants used the teletype to have a ‘conversation’ with the computer. The computer program I wrote used the data from the conversation to draw an image in response to the individual interaction utilizing a graph plotter which operated a pen, a drawing machine, much different from the typical printers we have nowadays. The images were produced using data from the plans of the Vickers building [now known as the Millbank Tower], next to Tate Modern. The program allocated space inside or around the building based on the conversation. The work was called <em>DataPack</em> because we gave each participant a plastic folder with a copy of their dialogue and the image that was generated especially for them.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-05-ernest-edmonds\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_05_ernest_edmonds\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A collage of notes, sketches, photographs, handwritten and typed notes by the artist Ernest Edmonds about his artwork DATAPACK\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_05_ernest_edmonds.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Ernest Edmonds, Notes on interaction, 2003, digital collage of the artist’s notes including sketches, photographs, handwritten and typed notes on the artwork DATAPACK, 1970, and the INTERACTProject, 1980, 78.7 x 46.9 cm.

I did not think of it as a tool, but as a new medium that opened opportunities to look at new art forms. I was also interested in psychology and systems theory. For <em>Communications Game</em>, I started to investigate psychology and to learn about language, communication methods and behaviour. In this work, I saw the opportunity to produce a networked experience where several people could interact with one another through the artwork. It was before the internet, so I designed an electronic circuit which I physically assembled to produce a network of six stations for the participants. The challenge of just using lights and switches for the interactions was to enable it to feel meaningful rather than random. I built later versions for exhibitions in 1973 and beyond. Later versions were shown, for example, in 1990 in ‘Art Creating Society’ at what used to be called the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, and in 2015 in ‘Primary Codes’ at Oi! Futuro, Rio de Janeiro.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-06-ernest-edmonds\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_06_ernest_edmonds\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Typed notes and a diagram related to the interactive artwork Communications Games by artist Ernest Edmonds\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_06_ernest_edmonds.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Ernest Edmonds, Notes on Communication Games, 2000, documentation including types notes and diagrams relating to the artwork Communications Games, 1969, 68.8 x 56.7 cm.

However, by the early 2000s most interactive art was based on action response, which is more related to game models. Contradicting this trend, I decided that I wanted to make artworks that dealt with the first type of interaction, so I started the <em>Shaping Form</em> series (2007–12). These works are composed of two main parts. The first one is a camera, which detects movement, connected to a computer (some versions can pick up on sound or other aspects of the environment). And the second one is a screen that presents the audience with a generative visual experience, including a response to their presence. The work at the V&amp;A was the first one I did. The main principle of the work is that the computer keeps track of the movement, and in response, it is constantly readjusting the rules that generate the image sequence. It is a rule-based generative work which can produce an infinite number of different arrangements of shapes and colours, evolving as a result of participant interaction.</p>\n<p>More recently, I have been working on extensions of <em>Communications Game</em>, utilizing the internet and ideas from <em>Shaping Form</em>: <em>the</em> <em>Cities Tango</em> series. For example, in 2021, I developed a piece for the British Pavilion in the Dubai Expo that connected that space with the streets of Leicester. I used cameras and screens to create one station in each location, so people from Dubai could interact with the people in Leicester through colour and images. In this work, the audience keeps influencing the work as the program continues to learn and evolve over time. Most of my recent work links interactive art with communication technologies.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-07-ernest-edmonds\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_07_ernest_edmonds\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"White and slim square monitor with an integrated video camera displaying an interactive computer-generated artwork that features a sequence of overlapping vertical rectangles in high contrasting colours\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_07_ernest_edmonds.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Ernest Edmonds, Shaping Form 14/5/2007, 2007, generative interactive computational work on a square monitor, 41.6 x 41 x 7.5 cm.

These themes can be found in the <em>Shaping Form</em> series and in your collaborative work with the cognitive scientist Margaret A. Boden. It would be fantastic to hear more about this collaboration.</p>\n<p><strong>EE:</strong> Artificial intelligence (AI) is integral to much of my work; even just the analysis of people’s movement is using AI techniques, and the evolutionary aspect of the work relates to AI in a bigger sense. I do not just mean machine learning, in the modern world these concepts often get confused.</p>\n<p>I have expanded on this work and collaborated with other people interested in the topic, such as Margaret Boden. In 2019, Maggie and I published the book <em>From Fingers to Digits. An Artificial Aesthetic</em> to address the use of software and AI in computer art. We first met in a remote and lovely place in Australia, Lamington National Park, where we both presented at a conference on creativity. We frequently talked. She came and spent time in Australia with me, and I often went to Sussex where she was professor of cognitive science at the university. We had a very strong mutual interest in creativity and AI. I was interested in amplifying human creativity and Maggie was interested in modelling creativity, so we started to do some writing together. In 2009, we published an article ‘What Is Generative Art?’* in the <em>Digital Creativity</em> journal,* and we decided to write a book together. It took a long time, but you can see in that 2019 publication that we agreed on many issues related to AI. We were part of the same circle. Although she is not an artist, she was very closely connected with the art world. We had many friends in common, including the artist Harold Cohen. She is really a philosopher, although she is more famously known as a cognitive scientist. In her writing, you can see how she has applied her interest in philosophy to computer science.</p>\n<p>Apart from AI, colour is another key element in my work. I found that with computing I was able to build computational systems that controlled colour. When I worked at Loughborough University in the 1990s, some of my colleagues were researching colour for commercial purposes and working with companies such as Marks &amp; Spencer to establish computational methods that dealt with how colour was perceived. And I was able to draw from this research and start looking at colour computationally from a perceptual psychology perspective.</p>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> Throughout your career, you have been part of groups and social organizations within and beyond the UK that have contributed to the development of the digital arts, for example CAS. Could you talk about these and other digital-art communities in the UK and globally that have been influential to the development of your practice?</p>\n<p><strong>EE:</strong> Stroud Cornock and I formed an informal group in Leicester towards the end of the 1960s and brought in various active artists from elsewhere. But the first formal organization that I joined was CAS and, in fact, Stroud and I gave a talk at one of their 1970 meetings about what we were doing in Leicester. CAS has been an important community, both nationally and internationally. I have already mentioned <em>Leonardo</em>. The community associated with that journal has been, and still is, an important one; enabling publications, encouraging debate and interchange. Art communities that I belonged to that took a serious interest in the use of computers without focusing on it included Exhibiting Space, a London artist-led group initiated by the artist Ray Thomson, and the PRO Foundation based in the Netherlands and led by artist and curator Fré Ilgen. These two communities originated very interesting dialogues between artists using computers and others who worked in the Constructivist tradition, often employing mathematics. The first International Symposium on Electronic Art was held in Utrecht in 1988 and I contributed to it. This led to a series of regular symposia, with the shortened title of ISEA International, that still operates today and had formed a significant community, overlapping with CAS. It is run by a formal foundation with a legal base in the Netherlands. Another community, which is strongly multi-disciplinary and includes computer scientists, cognitive scientists and others interested in creativity as well as computer-based artists, is based on the Association for Computing Machinery’s (ACM) Creativity and Cognition (C&amp;C) conference series, which I founded in 1993 with Linda Candy. As with ISEA, this is also lively today.</p>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> We talked about your early collaboration with Stroud Cornock, but your involvement with these communities must have led to other partnerships.</p>\n<p><strong>EE:</strong> Yes, very much so. I have often collaborated, sometimes technically, with other artists. For example, on performances with Mark Fell, whose work is grounded in electronic music, and on distributed interaction with Sean Clark, who currently chairs CAS. There have been many others, including PhD students who are often as much collaborators as students. I am currently working with Jonathan Knoblauch, who is an expert on quantum computing. All these collaborations help to keep moving on. And the communities I mentioned are also still important to me. We still have CAS, <em>Leonardo</em>, ISEA, C&amp;C and other groups pressing ahead as communities advancing the computer-based arts. Of course, all of these are specialist groups. In the UK, the V&amp;A recognized, and started collecting, computer-based art quite some time ago, but public bodies have mostly been slow to follow that lead. However, we can now see significant examples of integration into the mainstream, both in the commercial and the public sectors.</p>\n","length":3845,"title":"Interview: Ernest Edmonds","type":"essay","url":"https://vanda.github.io/vam-publications-hubs-nodes-and-networks/interview-ernest-evans/"},{"content":"<p>William Latham (b. 1961, United Kingdom) is a visual artist, computer scientist and computer games designer who applies evolutionary theory to art making. He is well known for his work <em>Mutator</em> (1989–present), an evolutionary software system that generates variations of organic life in 3D forms. Early iterations of <em>Mutator</em> can be found in his works created at IBM – <em>Colid Horn (Twist 5)</em> (1987), <em>Tube 1</em> (1987) and <em>Twister 1</em> (1988) – which are part of the V&amp;A’s Digital Art Collection.</p>\n<p><strong>Pita Arreola:</strong> Could we begin with your earliest encounters with digital art and how you came to incorporate certain methodologies and technologies into your practice?</p>\n<p><strong>William Latham:</strong> I grew up in a village near the Harwell Atomic Research Centre, in Oxfordshire. My family and all our friends were scientists who worked there using software, computers and, of course, mathematics. This had a big influence on me. Right from the start, I was thinking about technology and molecular diagrams. My father was an industrial chemist, so I was very familiar with molecular imagery and that set me in a particular direction.</p>\n<p>When I went to the Ruskin School of Art at the University of Oxford in 1979, the students were fortunate enough to be allowed to explore the various departments, so I would go and work in the Physics Department and also the Computer Department.</p>\n<p>It was at the Oxford University Computing Department that I first came across and used plotters and programming in Fortran 77. I started then to be aware of what was happening in the software space, particularly with artificial intelligence (AI) systems, like ELIZA. Even though computers were very limited, a lot of interesting work was being developed.</p>\n<p>In 1982, I went to study a master’s degree at the Royal College of Art (RCA), in London, and I had the opportunity to connect with a wider group of people.</p>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> You also took contemporary dance classes while you were a student at the Ruskin School of Art.</p>\n<p><strong>WL:</strong> Yes, that was a big event. Arlette Bonne, who was over from the USA, was running a workshop at the Museum of Modern Art Oxford [now Modern Art Oxford]. She got us walking, tracing out choreographic paths, in particular moving in geometric patterns. As the group walked along these paths, you would see patterns that emerged. After that, I took those ideas into drawings, which reflected these choreographic paths in 2D and then I pulled them up into 3D. In this way, they became three dimensional objects that were rule-based but inspired by choreography. Until that point, I’d been doing paintings in the style of Francis Bacon. I threw all that away, and then became much more interested in Russian Constructivism and rule-based art. Kenneth Martin taught me there; he was applying dice throwing to generate a drawing system. I had an immediate affinity with the beautiful drawings he produced.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-01-kenneth-martin\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_01_kenneth_martin\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Screenprint of a geometrical figure composed of parallel line arrangements of variable lengths, directions and colours\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_01_kenneth_martin.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Kenneth Martin, Chance and Order I, 1971, screenprint, 68.2 x 68.2 cm.

It is a record of the dance patterns in 3D. That was a key moment of change for my work, and I stuck with that track until I got to the RCA. Then I met a new set of lecturers: artists like Patrick Heron, John Hoyland and Alistair Grant. They were quite challenging, and they pushed me to do something novel again.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-02-william-latham\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_02_william_latham\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Screenprint with four different perspectives of a wooden spiral structure that appears to be flying against a yellow square background\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_02_william_latham.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">William Latham, Spiral Balsa Wood Structure, 1982, silk screenprint, 55 x 43.5 cm.

And were there connections between the school and industry at that time?</p>\n<p><strong>WL:</strong> I was quite isolated at that time because my colleagues were doing paintings in the style of Julian Schnabel, and I was doing these obsessive patterned drawings using rule-based systems. I found little in common there with my fellow students, but I was lucky to be working with the artist Keith Critchlow. And the artist Eduardo Paolozzi was a big influence on me there. He was one of my main mentors. I still think about some of the advice he gave me. The RCA had a Computing Department; the artist Brian Reffin Smith and architect John Lansdown were attached to it. That department was ahead of its time. During that time, I often visited the Natural History Museum, in London, and spent time at the V&amp;A looking at Tantric art and mandala imagery.</p>\n<p>From about 1985 to ‘87, I was doing a PhD with John Lansdown and Keith Critchlow, working with a very good programmer called Mike King, who helped me translate my ideas into software. Around that time, Lansdown hosted meetings at the Computer Arts Society (CAS) in Covent Garden. They were great events, and I became part of that community. The artist Paul Brown was heavily involved with CAS. He gave me a part-time teaching job at Middlesex Polytechnic [now Middlesex University]. At that point, the computer graphics scene in London was beginning to take off. Lansdown had done the 1979 <em>Alien</em> film intro. Other key figures of the community were the artists Chris Briscoe and John Vince, who wrote a software package called PICASSO that many production houses were using for special effects. And there was the interaction designer Gillian Crampton Smith who was at the RCA. It was a very small and thriving community of people in London involved with computer software and graphics.</p>\n<p>In 1987, I got an invitation from IBM that I followed up with a call. By chance, I got the nuclear physicist Peter Quarendon on the phone and he invited me to IBM in Winchester to show my drawings to Stephen Todd and five other engineers. I went there with my 10-foot drawings and explained the rules that I was applying. Three months later, they invited me to be an artist in residence with the programming team using new software coded in the Energy System Modelling Environment (ESME) and ray tracing. In a Renaissance fashion, IBM created a scientific centre where people from different disciplines worked together. I was at IBM Winchester for six years and during that time I lost contact with the London art scene. But I started to work more internationally. I went abroad to the conferences organized by the Special Interest Group on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques (SIGGRAPH) and IMAGINA in Monte Carlo, which was an annual festival and big hub of computer graphics in that region. I had the solo exhibition ‘Empire of Form’ in 1990 at the O Art Museum, in Tokyo, where I spent time with the artist Yoichiro Kawaguchi. At that time, there were no PCs around, so artists had to operate in the corporate space to gain access to big machines. Companies were looking for people who would generate research and enhance their reputation by showing off the capability of their hardware and software.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-03-william-latham\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_03_william_latham\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Etching depicting the evolution of complex geometrical forms using a set of transformation rules composed by the artist William Latham\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_03_william_latham.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">William Latham, Family of Forms, 1985, black and white etching depicting the evolution of complex forms using a simple set of transformation rules, 70.5 x 57 cm.

Film companies premiered feature films at the conferences. People like Jinn Blinn, Alan Nolte Milton, Manuel Brock, Ken Perlin and Yoichiro Kawaguchi were presenting papers there. And it had an art show running in parallel to the conference. With IBM backing me, I was able to attend every year. In 1989, I showed my 35mm film <em>A Sequence from the Evolution of Form</em>. These events helped me to gain international recognition and to connect with incredible innovators whose technology is still used today.</p>\n<p>The catch was that as soon as you got involved with technology and corporations, the art world did not like it. My work was increasing in popularity during the early 1990s and being shown in the scientific domain, at the Natural History Museum, in London, and the Deutsches Museum, in Munich. At that time, there was a lot of enmity between the art world and the computer graphics scene. Not like now – they really did not like computer art at all.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-04-william-latham\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_04_william_latham\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Computer-generated three-dimensional image printed on photographic paper showcasing a sequence of golden spirals that are shaped like a twisted horn wrapped in a circular form against a black backdrop\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_04_william_latham.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">William Latham, Coild Horn (Twist 5), 1987, Cibachrome print after a computer-generated image, 48.5 x 41.5 cm.

It was always a bit casual. People called it either ‘computer art’ or sometimes ‘computer graphics’. And definitely using the word ‘graphics’ wasn’t good, as it implied a lower rung in the hierarchy. On top of that, the audience was questioning whether the creativity was coming from the artist or the software. There was a lot of friction between practitioners working with technology and the art world, and it has taken almost 30 years for that reconciliation to happen. It’s only now that most of the population in the UK are using PCs or technology that the audience has become more sympathetic to the challenges embedded to technological tools and its associated themes.</p>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> Over the years, you have collaborated with different individuals across the UK and internationally, including John Lansdown, Paul Brown, Stephen Todd, Mark Ayres, Frederic Fol Leymarie and Mike Sternberg. Could you tell us about these collaborations and the expertise they have brought to your practice?</p>\n<p><strong>WL:</strong> Over the years, I have collaborated closely with Stephen Todd, and later with Professor Frederic Fol Leymarie from Goldsmiths’ College [now Goldsmiths, University of London]. There are some collaborations where I am working with individuals every single day, especially for software-based projects. For example, when I work with Stephen Todd, he writes a piece of software, I try it out and make many comments. He will then review these notes and implement changes. We work within a very tight feedback loop. In fact, with programmers and mathematicians, the quicker you can provide feedback, the better because they often work very quickly and thrive on that speed. Many of my collaborations are framed by software development methods where you are working together to engineer the software. My role includes setting deadlines based on the opening of exhibitions and projects.</p>\n<p>Mike Sternberg is the director of the Centre for Integrative Systems Biology and Bioinformatics at Imperial College London, with interest in the field of cancer and protein docking. He had one of my works at his home and Frederic introduced us. During that conversation he mentioned the way my forms are structured has some similarities with the beta-sheet structure in protein molecules and he suggested applying the technology I was using in their scientific problems. After that, Stephen Todd and his son Peter got involved in the project. They are both incredible programmers and they found a way to adapt our software to Stenberg’s scientific research. The challenge with these types of collaborations is that they are labelled as science and never art. But when you, as an artist, work with science, the ideas get pulled back into your art. You can see this particularly with the virus work we did with Professor Reidun Twarock at the University of York where we learnt so much about capsid shells but ultimately found ourselves viewing them in aesthetic terms. In a way, it is similar to the process of drawing from nature to create a painting, although we are looking at nature on a molecular level. Ultimately, the art that is produced is abstract but it is informed by molecular perspective.</p>\n<p>Additionally, throughout my career, there have been key support figures like Professor Robert Zimmer, who was Head of Computing at Goldsmiths for eight years. He was very caring and created a good environment that enabled the formation of a strong community in the university. The scientist Margaret A. Boden is a big champion of artificial intelligence and she encouraged me and backed my work.</p>\n<p>Another significant figure was the Surrealist painter Roberto Matta who bought some of my work. I visited his studio in Paris, and we were together in a panel conversation for the IMAGINA festival about computers and Surrealist art in 1990. Matta was trained as an architect, so structure and form are core elements of his work. He also applied chance to his painting practice which was a popular theme within Surrealist ideologies. They used the dice to generate random numbers and I applied – and still apply – random number generators to create <em>Mutator</em>.</p>\n<p>Paolozzi, who I mentioned earlier, had a significant impact on me when he was my professor at the RCA. I wasn’t working with him on a daily basis, but he was always challenging me. He would often advise me to leave art school and work in the computer software environment to make a living. I learned from Paolozzi that you should pursue what interests you and not care about whatever everyone else thinks.</p>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> Are there other individuals based in the UK who have influenced or supported your practice, or who you consider have made key contributions to the UK digital art ecosystem?</p>\n<p><strong>WL:</strong> Jasia Reichardt obviously, who curated the first computer art exhibition in the UK, ‘Cybernetic Serendipity’, at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), London, back in 1968 (and celebrated in a retrospective a few months ago). I got to know her and her work many years later after her audacious debut, but she remained and remains a powerful force within this area and has always been supportive of my work. Although not in the UK, the Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.) group in New York, also from the late ’60s, was very influential. Barry Barker, who was the director of the Arnolfini, and Stephen Snoddy, who was a curator there, were big advocates for my work. The support from the V&amp;A has been really good over the years. And the Henry Moore Institute, in Leeds, backed my work too; I was a Henry Moore scholar at the RCA. In fact, I knew Henry Moore quite well. The team at Gazelli Art House and Valentina Ravaglia, Curator of Displays and International Art at Tate Modern, both in London, have provided incredible support during the last year.</p>\n<p>Outside of the UK, I should also mention Frédéric Migayrou, Deputy Director of the Centre Pompidou, in Paris, and Anna Frants, Director of CYFEST: International Media Art Festival, which is hosted in a different city every year.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-05-william-latham\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_05_william_latham\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Artist William Latham posing, standing next to his artworks at the exhibition ‘The Conquest of Form’ at the Arnolfini Gallery, Bristol\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_05_william_latham.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">William Latham at ‘The Conquest of Form’ exhibition at the Arnolfini Gallery, Bristol (02 December 1988 - 14 January 1989)</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Artist William Latham posing, standing next to his artworks at the exhibition ‘The Conquest of Form’ at the Arnolfini Gallery, Bristol\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_05_william_latham.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">William Latham at ‘The Conquest of Form’ exhibition at the Arnolfini Gallery, Bristol (02 December 1988 - 14 January 1989)</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> Throughout your career, you have been part of groups and social formations that have existed within and beyond the UK, contributing to the development of the digital arts. For example, CAS and the computing community at Goldsmiths. Could you expand on these and other digital art communities in the UK and globally that you belong to, which have been influential to the development of your practice?</p>\n<p><strong>WL:</strong> Cyber was a key counter-culture movement. When I finished at IBM, my audience was not mainstream, it was formed by people who were going to raves, dancing to music and watching my work. All my videos had been bootlegged and were projected in huge garages and factories. This is why I went from IBM to the entertainment industry where I worked with different record labels and music bands, like the famous Scottish psychedelic band The Shamen. After that, Warner Brothers approached me to do art inspired by organic life. Then I drifted into the video game industry for almost 10 years and ended up directing a big studio of around 70 people where we created games that at the time were visually quite cutting-edge.</p>\n<p>During the 1990s, people who were doing interesting work tended to either become academics or go into cyber culture. This cultural moment was characterized by a celebratory attitude towards technology with figures like Bruce Sterling and William Gibson working on the genre of cyberpunk. It was quite similar to the moment we are living now with artificial intelligence being in the public eye. Culturally, the 1990s was a very exciting period with a lot of excitement around the internet, rave music and sampling.</p>\n<p>In 2004, Mick Grierson, Janis Jefferies and Frederic Fol Leymarie formed the Digital Arts Computing course at Goldsmiths (Grierson would later go on to set up the Creative Computing Institute at University of the Arts London). I was invited around that time to help build that group. Goldsmiths became a centre for computer art and computational creativity with a strong critical mass composed of the teaching staff and PhD students. Goldsmiths had a push on virtual and augmented reality, alongside medical work. It continues to operate today as a strong cluster for innovation.</p>\n<p>Regarding these digital communities, Middlesex Polytechnic was a hub for computer art in the 1990s. John Lansdown and Paul Brown were involved, and I worked there in the early days. The Polytechnic had equipment and hardware like the Quantel Paintbox. Leicester Polytechnic [now De Montfort University] was another cluster with Ernest Edmonds and Sean Clark. Both Brown and Edmonds were influenced by the Systems art group which was formed in London during the 1970s. Another interesting cluster was the National Centre for Computer Animation at Bournemouth University with Peter Comninos and John Vince where they were doing work with film and computer graphics. Gareth Edwards, who studied at the RCA with me, became part of that group.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-06-william-latham\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_06_william_latham\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Artist William Latham looking at a printed diagram of computer-generated forms while seated at his desk with five computer monitors and multiple keyboards in the IBM UK Scientific Centre, Winchester\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_06_william_latham.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">William Latham working on an early version of Mutator at the IBM UK Scientific Centre, Winchester, 1988. </span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Artist William Latham looking at a printed diagram of computer-generated forms while seated at his desk with five computer monitors and multiple keyboards in the IBM UK Scientific Centre, Winchester\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_06_william_latham.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">William Latham working on an early version of Mutator at the IBM UK Scientific Centre, Winchester, 1988. </span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> As a practitioner with expertise in the field of artificial evolutionary systems, could you outline some of the key technologies and tools that have made your practice possible?</p>\n<p><strong>WL:</strong> I have had the luxury of having access to custom software, which is really important because it gives the work a different look. Some artists are using Unreal or Photoshop and you can spot the aesthetics; it is the same with programs like Midjourney or DALL-E. That is the reason why I have always pushed on using customized technology. In the early days, I did work for the BBC using BBC BASIC and BBC microcomputers. I used Fortran 77 for the work I developed when studying at Oxford.</p>\n<p>When I was at IBM, we were using proprietary software, and a language called Extensible Solid Modelling Editor (ESME). There was also WINSOM, a Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) modelling package which allowed you to do Boolean operators where you could take a sphere and subtract a cube from it in a precise way similar to carving. The forms are very defined because you utilize spatial subdivisions instead of polygons, and the cuts are applied to individual pixels. Chris Briscoe and John Vince’s PICASSO interactive graphics modelling program was very good for handcrafting during the 1980s.</p>\n<p>Historically, I have tended to only use the software I have developed with my collaborators. At the moment, I am using tools like Geiger pixels where you can take an image and increase its resolution. Virtual reality (VR) is very important for my work. We mainly use HTC Vive PCs which run the experience in real time at 90 frames per second. VR is a new tool and art form where, if the work operates successfully, you can conceptually shift the audience’s spatial reality. In VR, the audience ceases to be merely an observer and becomes part of the artwork, which is very powerful from an engagement point of view.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-07-william-latham\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_07_william_latham\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Computer-generated three-dimensional image of a square room containing a mutated circular organism composed of multiple tentacles curled towards its centre\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_07_william_latham.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">William Latham, Zapx4rgg raytraced in red room, 1993, computer-generated image from Mutator Software developed by William Latham and Stephen Todd</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Computer-generated three-dimensional image of a square room containing a mutated circular organism composed of multiple tentacles curled towards its centre\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_07_william_latham.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">William Latham, Zapx4rgg raytraced in red room, 1993, computer-generated image from Mutator Software developed by William Latham and Stephen Todd</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> We have discussed some of the references of your work such as Surrealism, Tantric art and nature. It would also be interesting to hear more about the thinkers and theoretical concepts that have helped shape your work.</p>\n<p><strong>WL:</strong> Conceptually, once the software has been built, the computer becomes a creative partner. In this scenario, there is an evolutionary interface between the artist and the software. Once you fine-tune the software, it can be quite addictive to play with the systems, because you never know what these will give back to you. I find this part of the work very enjoyable and that is what makes me ready to spend hours developing the theory that will deliver that experience. My motivation is the fascination with the potential and limitations of human creativity and the generative power of the machine. Theoretically, my work goes back to classical Greek thinking about solid geometry, perspective, mathematics, and the celebration of mathematics and arts. The work can be a bit contentious, as it contains Freudian elements and deliberately tries to play with people’s fears, showcasing bugs and worms at a microscopic perspective, though as well as being uncanny, it’s often quite humorous. The biologist and mathematician D’Arcy Thompson is a big influence on me, as is Leonardo da Vinci’s idea of illusionary depth and use of perspective.</p>\n","length":4247,"title":"Interview: William Latham","type":"essay","url":"https://vanda.github.io/vam-publications-hubs-nodes-and-networks/interview-william-latham/"},{"content":"<p>John Lifton (b. 1944, United Kingdom) is an artist and theorist whose work explores the relationships between art, science, the environment and technology. In 1968, he co-founded the Institute for Research in Art and Technology in London (IRAT, also known as the New Arts Lab), a pivotal space for the avant-garde art scene that enabled experimentation in film, video, sculpture and literature.</p>\n<p><strong>Pita Arreola:</strong> Reflecting on the beginning of your career, could you elaborate on your earliest encounters with computer art and how you came to incorporate certain methodologies and technologies into your practice?</p>\n<p><strong>John Lifton:</strong> Growing up, I had a particular disposition towards analogue and mechanical tools, but to properly answer your question I have to go back to my mother’s influence. She was born in Argentina, of British parents. My grandfather had migrated with his family from Devonshire as a teenager. He was a very bright guy and got a job on the building of a railroad system from scratch with a contract underwritten by the British and Argentine governments. He ended up doing surveys to determine where the lines would go and contributing towards the design of the stations, depots, even writing the timetables. I think my mother wanted me to be like him. I saw him as a Renaissance man of the First Machine Age.</p>\n<p>The Second World War was just over when I was little, so my mother wanted me to have a great education for the post-war world. As an amateur painter, she started taking me to museums and galleries in London when I was 18 months old, and I loved it. We lived in Northwood on the Metropolitan Line, and we could get into the city centre in little over half an hour. We would spend the whole day looking at museums and have lunch at Lyons’ Corner House. My favourite outing was the British Museum and especially the Egyptian collection from which I developed a lifelong love of Egyptology. So, my interest in art, tools and machinery was deeply embedded in me by about the age of five and continued all my life. I was also incredibly interested in seeing buildings under construction, and I’m told I announced at five that I would be an architect when I grew up.</p>\n<p>Later, I went to the Merchant Taylors’ School which was at Moor Park, nearby. I was the only student who had a special dispensation to trade out some of the science time to work in the art studio. Even then, I insisted on doing both art and science. I don’t know when I first came across computer art; it hardly existed as a category back then. Most people, if you mentioned computer art, would give you a totally blank look as it didn’t mean anything. At that time, I was thinking of an artist’s studio as a place extended to include design and the construction of electronics and computing equipment. The other people that I knew with a similar perspective were musicians, because electronics had penetrated music more than other areas of the arts.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-01-owen-jones\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_01_owen_jones\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Architectural drawing on paper of an Egyptian temple that displays in its facade colourful murals with historic scenes  \" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_01_owen_jones.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Owen Jones, architectural drawing of an entrance pylon to an Egyptian temple, circa 1853, watercolour, 25.1 x 17.4 cm.

Machine: Man: Society’ (1973), organized by the Computer Arts Society (CAS) for the Edinburgh International Festival; and ‘Green Music’ (1975) at Whitechapel Gallery, in London. Could you tell us about these and other events that were both memorable and important in establishing the digital art scene or circle that your practice originates from? And which helped raise the profile of that community?</p>\n<p><strong>JL:</strong> At that time there were very few people working in this area and they were all over Britain. Some were concentrated in London, but it still was a tiny group. Most people that I knew who were involved in computer art were always struggling to get an hour or two on a computer. When I look back at the people that my wife Pamela Zoline and I knew back then, they were artists such as Joe Tilson, Ron Kitaj and Richard Hamilton. Their work did not focus on computer art, but they were interested in the broader spectrum of what was going on in the arts.</p>\n<p>I was heavily involved in the founding of the New Arts Lab at Robert Street, in London, in 1968, and got to know the composer Hugh Davies who oversaw music there. We were close friends and in 1970 we started a music performance group called Naked Software with the composer Annea Lockwood and producer Harvey Matusow. We toured around the country with two hundred instruments that we used for our improvisations during the performances.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-02-john-lifton\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_02_john_lifton\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Music installation generating electronic music utilising the frequency of six medium size plants in their pots, exhibited at Whitechapel Art Gallery, London\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_02_john_lifton.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">John Lifton, ‘Green Music’ exhibition at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, London (29 May - 6 July 1972)</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Courtesy of the Whitechapel Gallery Photo: Michael Dunn</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Music installation generating electronic music utilising the frequency of six medium size plants in their pots, exhibited at Whitechapel Art Gallery, London\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_02_john_lifton.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">John Lifton, ‘Green Music’ exhibition at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, London (29 May - 6 July 1972)</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Courtesy of the Whitechapel Gallery Photo: Michael Dunn</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> Around the period these events took place, what specific vocabulary was being used to describe digital art? It would be good to hear about them given how terminologies have been used and changed across different periods.</p>\n<p><strong>JL:</strong> The term ‘cybernetics’ was very commonly used back then. I think I learned about it from the cybernetician George Mallen who had got it from the cybernetician Gordon Pask. The second term is ‘symbiotic art’ which I proposed myself in discussions I had with the writer and systems engineer Jonathan Benthall in 1969. I thought the term provided a good description of the work I was doing which was aiming to generate real-time behavioural interaction between people and artworks. Jonathan made that term public in an article he published in the art magazine <em>Studio International</em> in June 1969. I still see it used occasionally, but with a different intent. Generally, ‘computer art’ was a huge general term which swallowed everything.</p>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> Over the years, you have collaborated with different individuals across the UK and abroad including Richard Lowenberg, John Lansdown, David Curtis and Carolee Schneemann. Could you tell us about these collaborations and the expertise they have brought to your practice?</p>\n<p><strong>JL:</strong> There were two quite different art movements that I was lucky to be deeply involved with in the mid-to-late ‘60s. And neither of them were style movements. The first was the Computer Arts Society (CAS). At the time it was formed, its goal was to promote the creative use of computers in the arts and to encourage the interchange of information in this area. As I can remember, it was my friend, the artist Gustav Metzger, who told me that CAS had been formed the previous week and gave me John Lansdown’s contact information. I went to John’s office the next day and signed up, becoming among the eight early members. That was the start of a period when I worked closely with CAS and often provided labour to help with their activities. For several years, the society ran regular meetings and there would be additional meetings when someone of interest was in town. These meetings were held at John’s architectural office in Bloomsbury during the early years.</p>\n<p>The other art movement that I was involved with was the Arts Labs. Jim Haynes, who created it, was an American who had moved to Edinburgh in the late 1950s and founded Britain’s first paperback bookshop, which he ran like his personal salon in the manner of an eighteenth-century coffee house where people gathered for a conversation or commerce. People met and talked all day, every day, and he was there talking to them. He was very skillful at this, and he had a huge effect on things. The Paperback Bookshop staged plays on a small scale and that led Jim to found the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh during 1962. He moved to London in 1964 and opened the first Arts Lab in Drury Lane, which was an enlarged version of the salon, but it immediately became a centre of the London art scene for my generation.</p>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> What do you think brought these different groups of people together?</p>\n<p><strong>JL:</strong> I think there was a mood of change and a sense of leaving the war behind us. We were a new generation that did not have any experience of the war and wanted to do new things. We wanted the art world to be less strictly divided than it had been in the past. We were breaking barriers and mixing things up in order to try new stuff and that was a very dominant feeling for my generation.</p>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> Are there other individuals who were based in the UK that have influenced or supported your practice, or whom you consider to have made key contributions to the UK digital art ecosystem?</p>\n<p><strong>JL:</strong> My first full-time job as an architect was working for Hackney Borough Council after graduating from the Bartlett School of Architecture, at University College London in 1966. The council assigned me a 810,000 square metre area of mid-Victorian housing called De Beauvoir Town to do a redevelopment study as part of their long-term planning. I think it was during the spring of 1967 when I was walking around the area with a colleague, and he mentioned I needed to meet someone. He took me into a rundown garage and introduced me to the cybernetic sculptor Edward Ihnatowicz working on his piece <em>Sound Activated Mobile</em> (SAM) which Ihnatowicz later showed at the ‘Cybernetic Serendipity’ exhibition at the ICA in 1968. We instantly became friends and I found many excuses to drop by and see him during my work day. He was a great inspiration to me because of his dedication and single-mindedness. I have no idea how he made a living because he seemed to be working full-time on his sculptural work. Seeing him made me consider for the first time whether I could stop working in architectural offices and become a professional computer artist.</p>\n<p>Shortly after this, a rebellion at the Drury Lane Arts Lab happened. I was part of the breakaway group that in 1969 created the New Arts Lab, at Robert Street. This group included the author Pamela Zoline, the artist David Curtis and his wife, the artist Biddy Peppin. Pamela and I just celebrated our fiftieth anniversary and that was the start of many very happy years. They had all been close friends of mine since I was at Bartlett because they were studying just next door at the Slade School of Fine Art.</p>\n<p>I did take the opening of the New Arts Lab as the opportunity to stop working in architecture and to set up a cybernetics workshop. I kind of moved to the lab and started working on stuff without any income. It was a big risk, but London was cheap then, and I got odd bits of jobs that helped me stay afloat. When we were setting up the Arts Lab, I persuaded the group to incorporate it as the Institute for Research in Art and Technology (IRAT), because I saw an opportunity to bridge the more hippie-orientated Arts Lab scene with the academic world. The institute only lasted a couple of years, but it did influence the London arts scene.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-03-institute-of-research\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_03_institute_of_research\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Street view of The Institute for Research in Art and Technology, New Arts Laboratory, showing an old industrial bricked building in Robert Street, London\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_03_institute_of_research.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">The Institute of Research in Art and Technology [New Arts Laboratory], Robert Street, Camden Town, London, 1969</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Photo: Pamela Zoline Courtesy of Pamela Zoline</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Street view of The Institute for Research in Art and Technology, New Arts Laboratory, showing an old industrial bricked building in Robert Street, London\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_03_institute_of_research.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">The Institute of Research in Art and Technology [New Arts Laboratory], Robert Street, Camden Town, London, 1969</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Photo: Pamela Zoline Courtesy of Pamela Zoline</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> Throughout your career, you have been part of groups and social formations that have existed within and beyond the UK, and have contributed to the development of the digital arts. For example, CAS and IRAT, both of which you mentioned earlier.</p>\n<p>Could you expand on these and other digital art communities that you belong to, that have been influential to the development of your practice?</p>\n<p><strong>JL:</strong> The Robert Street New Arts Lab moved on to be what was called The Dairy, in Chalk Farm. This space was less public, it operated more like private studios, although there were some public activities going on. That building, like the Robert Street one, had been leased from Camden Council on a nominal rent because the council bought those spaces to demolish them and build public housing. There were these short periods of two to three years before these buildings would get torn down where we could improve them and make use of them. Pamela and I felt that we needed something more settled after Drury Lane, Robert Street and the Dairy, so we bought a house in Dorset and started having children. I started teaching in 1974 at the RCA, in London, in the Department of Environmental Media and carried out research in the Design Research Department there too. Around that time, I wanted to expand my practice by doing more serious research and I obtained a grant from the UK’s Science Research Council to develop a project on computer simulation of cognition in architectural design.</p>\n<p>In 1977, Pam’s parents started building a ski area in Telluride, Colorado, and asked us to go there for a year to help with the business. At the end of the year, they sold the controlling interest to developers. We thought then that we would go back to Dorset, but the developers asked me to design a new resort town for a population of 8,000. It was an incredible opportunity, from a design point of view, and we decided to stay longer. For a variety of reasons, we just ended up living in Colorado and we are still here. My life changed completely at this point, because I stopped being heavily involved in digital art. But some of those ideas had continuity in other projects. Prior to Colorado, in London, I had met the artist Richard Lowenberg as we both were part of <em>The Secret Life of Plants</em> (released 1979) movie, for which I had taken my piece <em>Green Music (1973, and later versions)</em>, which made live music from the electrical activity within plants,* to Los Angeles and San Francisco to film it in operation. Richard had done other interactive work with dancers and other collaborators. We became very close friends. In 1979, Pam and I worked with Richard on an event called ‘Arts and Sciences’, which brought together artists and scientists to Telluride. It was so successful that in 1984 it led us to co-founding the non-profit Telluride Institute that operates across the spectrum of  arts, humanities and sciences. Richard worked with us for many years, before moving to Santa Fe. This year (2024) we have celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the Telluride Institute, and Richard, at the same time, put on a reprise of Arts and Sciences. His eight-day event was distributed on the internet by The Leonardo Art Science Evening Rendezvous (LASER).</p>\n<figure id=\"image-05-john-lifton\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_05_john_lifton\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Artist John Lifton seated on the floor, looking at the camera and smiling next to a signal processor installed on a small plant at the Conservatory of Flowers in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/jl;/image_05_john_lifton.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">John Lifton, Green Music, 1973, installation, rack of plant sensing, signal processing, and music synthesis systems, at the Conservatory of Flowers in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, USA, 1978</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">© Richard Lowenberg Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Artist John Lifton seated on the floor, looking at the camera and smiling next to a signal processor installed on a small plant at the Conservatory of Flowers in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/jl;/image_05_john_lifton.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">John Lifton, Green Music, 1973, installation, rack of plant sensing, signal processing, and music synthesis systems, at the Conservatory of Flowers in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, USA, 1978</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">© Richard Lowenberg Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> As a practitioner with expertise in the field of electronic systems and their relationship with natural processes, could you outline some of the key technologies and tools that have made your practice possible?</p>\n<p><strong>JL:</strong> It is hard to describe how primitive the field was back then. The reason I first got involved with technology was that I had a great love of music. Around the age of 10, I started building amplifiers, loudspeakers and other pieces of valve (tube) audio equipment. I used to get the parts from electronic component stores in London. I remember buying my first transistors a bit later. There were only three types of transistors that you could buy: red, green and white. They were all made on the same production line, and someone would manually test each one of them for gain and put on a colour paint spot.</p>\n<p>When I got interested in the creative use of computing, and not having any access to computers, I started building the circuits I needed, which were initially analogue. In the mid-1960s, the first integrated circuits (ICs) appeared. Back then, I remember going around the headquarters of the manufacturers in London and begging for gifts of integrated circuits for artistic use. Most of the time they were surprised and charmed that somebody would want to use their products for art, which made them generous. These early microchips had few logic gates or operations and typically contained 20 to 30 transistors within each chip. I could manage to design what I needed using them because it was very simple.</p>\n<p>Transistors and integrated circuits were key technologies in my early work, and they appeared just at the right time. Most of the people that I knew who were interested in computer arts back then managed to get occasional access to computer terminals that had online connections to digital computers which were running at 110 bits per second. The speed of this online connection seems useless now, but it was amazing and wonderful at that time. The Teletype ASR-33 terminals were a great hit, preceding personal computers.</p>\n<p>Later, when I set up the cybernetic workshop at the New Arts Lab in 1968, we installed an ASR-33 terminal. If it was for artistic purposes only, anybody could come and use it for free and it got quite a lot of use. I was told later that this was probably the first free computer terminal in the world dedicated solely to the arts.</p>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> Could you tell us how you managed supporting other artists to use this technology?</p>\n<p><strong>JL:</strong> I did not personally get involved in that, but these types of terminals were run using BASIC as a programming language. CAS put on training programmes to teach people how to use them, and there were many artists that got involved and put a lot of time into learning how to program and ended up producing very serious work. Colin Emmett, in particular, made heavy use of this terminal, sometimes working on it all through the night.</p>\n<p>The speed things were happening was remarkable. Only six years later, the RCA was the only arts institution in the world on the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), the forerunner of the internet, run by the USA military. When I worked there, the artist Harold Cohen visited the Design Research Department and produced a drawing which was programmed in San Diego and printed in London. We regarded this as the first true international work of computer art, because it was produced in real time across two continents.</p>\n<p>Harold had been Pamela’s teacher at the Slade. He moved to the USA in 1968 and worked as a lecturer at the University of California in San Diego. He ended up working there for 30 years and we would occasionally visit him. By the early 1970s, he had produced an early version of his computer program AARON, which generated paintings and drawings. I consider Harold’s work to be at that time the most sophisticated computer art that was being made anywhere. He was a first rate painter himself plus he really liked programming, which was an ideal combination.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-06-harold-cohen\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#image_06_harold_cohen\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Computer-generated drawing on paper displaying a composition of variable shapes that appear to be drawn by hand\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/image_06_harold_cohen.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Harold Cohen, Amsterdam Suite ‘C’, 1977, lithograph from a computer-generated drawing, 73 x 56 cm.

People were excited about getting their hands on computers and doing stuff. But there were two professors at Bartlett that really helped shape my thinking. The first one was the extraordinary engineer Richard Buckminster Fuller. He only came for a few days each year, but I found him incredibly interesting. He saw nature as the epitome of energy and material efficiency. He wanted engineering to imitate that, not formally, but he thought great design should produce the maximum performance-per-kilogram weight of the materials that you are using. And, geodesic domes, which he invented, for him were moving that concern as an engineer into architecture. I couldn’t have disagreed more with him, but this was very important at the same time. I still have a tiny bucket in a corner of my mind that uses this test on things. I’ll give you an example of why I don’t agree with Buckminster. I have a great admiration for Scandinavian sod roofs, which go back at least 1,500 years. These start with a layer of bark put down as a waterproofing layer. Then they dig up lots of sods, usually 15 to 20 centimetres deep. And they pack them on top to recreate the natural surface of the ground. And this is almost the antithesis of Buckminster’s goal. This roof is incredibly heavy, and it requires a massive wooden structure underneath to support that weight. From an engineering point of view it has a very low performance-per-kilogram weight. Why would one want to build a roof like that now? Well, first, the sod roof materials are cheap because they don’t need to be shaped much. Second, the materials come from the site, so they do not need to be transported. Third, the local ecosystem is preserved, and the roof will last for hundreds of years with very little maintenance. And finally, it’s beautiful and it’s a profound aesthetic statement about living gently on the land. My generation’s view of nature was totally different from his, which dated back to the 1930s.</p>\n<p>The second influential person is the architect Peter Reyner Banham, mostly known as Reyner Banham. He made his reputation by writing the first detailed description of the Modern Movement which treated it with the same historical seriousness as other major architectural movements. Banham was our on-staff history teacher at Bartlett. During my first year there, the Modern Movement was the only history that was taught, which was totally revolutionary at the time for a school of architecture. He later became my thesis supervisor and a very good friend. He was an advisory board member on the New Arts Lab. I think the important thing I learned from him was to have very high standards of accuracy and strictness in conducting research. This improved the quality of everything that I did, including artworks and anything that required study.</p>\n","length":4233,"title":"Interview: John Lifton","type":"essay","url":"https://vanda.github.io/vam-publications-hubs-nodes-and-networks/interview-john-lifton/"},{"content":"<p>Stephen Willats (b. 1943, United Kingdom) is a multidisciplinary artist who combines in his work cybernetics, advertising research, learning and communications theory, and computer technology. Since the early 1960s, Willats has located his work in individual and social behaviours and through collaborative and participatory artworks has sought to generate societal change.</p>\n<p><strong>Pita Arreola:</strong> Reflecting on the beginning of your career, could you elaborate on your earliest encounters with computer art and how you came to incorporate certain methodologies and technologies into your practice?</p>\n<p><strong>Stephen Willats:</strong> Foremost, I never thought of my [creative] life as a career. I always saw myself as an artist pursuing ideas. The idea that there would be structure in terms of a career never occurred to me. Now, to answer your question, we have to go back to 1958 when the world I was living in was changing remarkably quickly from the world that my parents lived in. Suddenly, there was a whole generation rebelling against the restrictions and conventions of earlier generations. All the barriers began to break down. People started to feel mobile and to think that a new vision of a world could be transformed into reality. These changes led to avant-garde ideas becoming prevalent at that time in the art world across Europe and the UK. From the point of view of the artist, we had the idea that a work of art needed to move forward and push things further.</p>\n<p>Remarkably, in 1958, I found myself working at Drian Galleries, in London, as a gallery assistant at a very young age and meeting significant artists from the UK, like Henry Moore and Francis Bacon, and from Europe and Latin America, such as Yaacov Agam, Lucio Fontana, Gyula Kosice and the Zero Group. The gallery was connected to Europe, which was very unusual at that time. Most of the galleries back then were linked to St Ives and the British tradition. During that time, I helped to organize and present many exhibitions including the solo and group shows of Stephen Gilbert, Piero Manzoni, the Group Zero and the British Constructivist artists, as well as Eastern European artists. Kosice and Agam were particularly important to me. Kosice was a socialist and had the idea that the audience should engage with the variables that the work was constructed from and find personal meaning in their experience by reorganizing the work’s configurations, so the work became interactive and the audience an active participant, instead of operating as a receiver of the message as you would do with radio. This concept was quite significant for me.</p>\n<p>Not many people came to the gallery, so I had plenty of free time. My father was an archivist and he managed to get books from the library that he passed to me. I read books by the philosophers Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Marshall McLuhan and the sociologist Basil Bernstein. Through them, I began to realize that the construction of the world was ideological and that the world I lived in could be different, and people could behave and socialize differently. I figured that instead of having vertical social hierarchies, there could be horizontal networks. When I was not reading, I drew sketches on how the gallery could function as a space, trying to improve the visitor experience. I thought we had all these fabulous exhibitions happening and nobody was coming. Through this analysis, it seemed to me that artworks demand at least two factors, person A and person B. In other words, there had to be a network of exchanges for the exhibition to really operate and have some meaning in the wider world.</p>\n<p>Another book my father gave me was <em>Mechanization of Thought Processes</em> (1958), based on a symposium that was organized by the National Physical Laboratory, in England, on the fundamentals of artificial intelligence (AI) and neural systems, and cybernetics as a philosophical and language modelling tool. Many significant practitioners attended this symposium such as the neurophysiologist and robotician William Grey Walter, the computer scientist Marvin Minsky, the cybernetician Gordon Pask and the scientist Heinz von Foerster.</p>\n<p>After reading that publication, I began to think about how neural systems could give us a model of society. Realizing that I needed to connect to all these ideas, I set up a think tank in 1961–2 with mathematicians, philosophers and artists. Theories sprang up all over the place, such as behavioural theory, game theory, lateral thinking theory, learning theory, random variable theory, probability theory and systems theory, just to name a few. Responding to these, I made a series of works that were to be part of my first exhibition at Gallery One, in central London, which was a famous avant-garde gallery at that time. These works were participatory and experienced in a sequence like a learning program, starting with <em>Work No. 1</em> (1962) a very simple set of variables and gradually increasing in complexity to <em>Work No. 6</em> (1962). Using a response sheet, participants could plot the changes they were making or their relationship with the work. These sheets were then exhibited next to the work and people could see that outcomes were relative to the individual person. Unfortunately, the gallery went bankrupt a month before my show. (Eventually these works were displayed in 2014 at the ‘Control. Stephen Willats. Work 1962–69’ exhibition curated by Alex Sainsbury at Raven Row, in London)</p>\n<p>Around that time, I realized that I needed new tools to develop further my ideas and one of the consequences was that I published a series of manifestos on topics related to the new attitudes and vision of art practice including Conceptualism and the omnidirectional nature of reality. I used to distribute them at gallery openings and the galleries did not like it. For this reason, I found myself out on the street quite often. But the idea of the manifestos was to disrupt things as they were and to create a conceptual and intellectual territory in which my ideas could be received. Then, the artist Dennis Bowen, who opened the New Vision Centre Gallery, in London, told me about this Groundcourse at Ealing School of Art run by the artist Roy Ascott and suggested that I left my job at the gallery and went there. The staff included the most relevant artists in London at that time, Brian Wall, Bernard and Harold Cohen, Anthony Benjamin and William Green, who was one of the first Auto-destructivers, even before the artist Gustav Metzger. It was a very radical group and an exciting place to go. Ascott had been in Newcastle and that region was very influenced by the artist László Moholy-Nagy and the Institute of Design in Chicago. For this reason, the course presented ideas of media dexterity. At that point, Ascott also made the statement that ‘theory should precede practice’ which changed culture.</p>\n<p>One day, Gordon Pask came to give a lecture. Not many students knew about his work, but I had read the paper he presented at the ‘Mechanization of Thought Processes’* symposium. His lecture introduced students to the idea of cybernetics and discussed relevant principles like feedback and the black box. I found the lecture very inspiring because it presented another type of society where instead of preserving information as power, there was a possibility of distributing information within an interactive network of mutuality. Bernard Cohen commented that Pask was trying to turn people into machines to which Pask responded, ‘You have infinite variables; you are not just machines’. His lecture had a profound impact on the staff, and it provoked a radical change in the work of that group of artists.</p>\n<p>In my case, in 1963, I went to work at the System Research Lab, in Richmond, where I met the cybernetician George Mallen and the mathematician Peter Whittle. This opened possibilities for creating a totally new language for artists. In artistic movements like Cubism and Futurism, artists were encoding reality through a language of objects. Whereas cybernetics presented a language that described a world based on the flow of information. I did not want to make pictures of cybernetics, I wanted to use it as a framework for engineering interactive simulation. Systems Research was significant for this process. Whittle was one of the early people using digital programs for electronic engineering and we discussed how I could build something. Then I met Chris Grimshaw, who was running a lab in Oxford, and he took over these discussions. Around this time, I developed a series of works based on the idea of cooperative behaviour that led to the creation of my work <em>Visual Homeostat</em> (1966–9).* This work is composed of two units which were coupled through photoelectric cells and an ultrasonic environment. The units were quite large, around 1.83 metres high by 3.65 metres wide, and the work was shown in a dark environment. As soon as the work detected someone within its ultrasonic field, it turned itself on and ran a program of lights which followed sequences over a mesh. The speed of the lights was reactive to the audience’s presence and they could also interfere with the activity between the units by standing between them and by doing so, triggering different programs. I made those works for a project at Tate that never took place.</p>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> Since early in your career, you have taken part in different events and exhibitions such as ‘Electric Theatre’, Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), London (1971); <em>‘<em>INTERACT Machine: Man: Society’ (1973), organized by the Computer Arts Society (CAS) for the Edinburgh International Festival; and ‘Structures and Codes’</em>,</em> Royal College of Art, London (1975). Could you tell us about these and other events that were both memorable and important in establishing the creative circle that your practice originates from, or that further raised the profile of your community of practice?</p>\n<p><strong>SW:</strong> During the 1960s many people from the underground cultural scene would come to my studio, as well as scientists such as Christopher Evans, Basil Bernstein, Edward de Bono and Desmond Morris, who were exploring language codes on apes. De Bono’s work was very influential for my work; he came up with the concept of ‘lateral thinking’ which challenges linear thinking. At that time people were trying to break down the barriers between different disciplines, so you had conversations between artists and scientists. The first exhibition that I had in 1964 was at a small gallery set up by doctors at the Chester Beatty Research Institute, a public research institute specialized in oncology situated in Fulham Road, London, because they understood all the potential of these ideas while the mainstream of the art world certainly did not. Shortly after this, in a period of self-doubt about the special role of the artist’s creativity, I stopped calling myself an artist and became a conceptual designer for nine months.</p>\n<p>Around that time, in 1965, I started <em>Control</em> magazine and made clothing like the example that is part of the V&amp;A’s collection. The idea was to create new ways to understand an artwork, for example, with the piece of clothing you could wear it and it changed your engagement with other people you might encounter and the world you passed through while wearing it. Additionally, you could buy it at a boutique instead of an art gallery. Though London galleries like Indica and Signals were very significant places at that time, they were not linked to digital art as you define it nowadays. Signals was linked to ideas of kineticism and was an important place for artists to connect with each other. Indica emerged later.</p>\n<p>I was part of this milieu. I met John Sharkey who was a concrete poet and also worked at the ICA. There was also a group of people who organized with Gustav Metzger the ‘Destruction in Art Symposium’ (1966). I was part of that team and helped to create the promotional materials. I also wrote an essay for a presentation, <em>The Mechanistic Crisis,</em> which looked at decision-making and problem-solving within hierarchical linear and self-organizing systems. The idea was that this symposium would bring people together just like ‘Mechanization of Thought Processes’ did for cybernetics at a time where the art world was becoming increasingly politicized with Marxism, determinism and anarchism. It was a very interesting period, but also became frightening as the 1960s progressed because people were becoming somewhat paranoid.</p>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> Around the period these events took place, what specific vocabulary was being used to describe digital art? It would be good to hear about that, considering how terminologies have changed across different periods.</p>\n<p><strong>SW:</strong> That was a problem, because I have been in many exhibitions with many different terminologies. Including ‘Kunst Licht Kunst’ (1966) at the Stedelijk van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, which was a major exhibition of light art, and ‘Kinetic four dimensional’ (‘K.4’) (1967) which took place at Brighton Festival and involved the designer Philip Steadman, who had placed particular emphasis in the field of kinetic art and concrete poetry. As well as, in London, the ICA’s ‘Electric Theatre’ (1971) and Hayward Gallery’s ‘Kinetic Art’ (1970)<em>,</em> where I presented <em>Visual Homeostatic Information</em> (1969–70). I found myself positioned and presented as a kinetic artist, which made me feel very uncomfortable because I was doing something quite different. After the show at Hayward, in the early 1970s, I set up the Centre for Behavioural Art at Gallery House, in London, and did the <em>Cognition Control</em> project (1972) at the Museum of Modern Art, in Oxford [now Modern Art Oxford], and Midland Group Gallery, in Nottingham. Around that period, education became part of my life again. I taught in Fine Art Departments, full time at Nottingham College of Art and Design [now Nottingham Trent University] and as visiting lecturer in universities across Exeter, Hornsey, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool and Newport. I also worked part time at Leicester Polytechnic [now De Montfort University] where I contributed to the ‘Invention of Problems’ symposium they were running in 1971. There were interesting things happening in the Midlands in the early 1970s and, specifically, there was a group of people concerned with what we now call digital art.</p>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> Are there any specific individuals who were based in the UK that have influenced or supported your practice, or who you consider to have made key contributions to the UK digital art ecosystem?</p>\n<p><strong>SW:</strong> To be truthful, I made it because I had this fortunate experience of meeting all these artists very early on. I didn’t really look to any other people for models; I thought I could make my own and did not want to emulate anyone else. Creating and working on <em>The Social Resource Projects</em> (1972–3), <em>The Edinburgh Social Model Construction Project</em> (1973) or <em>Visual Meta Language Simulation</em> (1971–2), and later <em>Meta Filter</em> (1973–5)<em>,</em> was thrilling because nobody’s ever done anything like that before. I believe art should create precedents and move on. Of course, I have met many people throughout my life, especially in the early 1970s when we set up the Centre of Behavioural Art at Gallery House. We had people from different disciplines like the mathematician Robert Bell and George Mallen presenting papers and I met European and Latin American artists.</p>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> We have spoken about some of the communities and groups in the UK that you have been part of, from counter-culture to CAS and the Auto-destructive art group. Could you expand on these and other art communities in the UK and globally that you belong to, that have been influential to the development of your practice?</p>\n<p><strong>SW:</strong> I was very much involved with innovative artists and thinkers that found themselves at the margins of the art world but nevertheless were setting the agenda for the years to come, such as concrete poets, and performance, digital and cybernetic artists. I thought at the time that we were part of a ‘counter consciousness’.</p>\n<p>Conversely, I had a lot of problems getting people to understand what I was doing. For example, I thought the work of art did not need the authorship of the artist to transmit meaning. So my work was anonymous. It was process- and event-based instead of object-based. All of these meant that I ended up marginalizing myself from the world of objects and the art market. This became a real problem when, around 1973, I found myself completely locked out of the institutional art world. I decided then to embark on work that would change the way art galleries operated by bringing into there inner real problems that mattered for people in the world outside. I wrote a paper in 1973 called <em>The Artist as an Instigator of Changes in Social Cognition and Behaviour,</em> which* presented different models of art operating simultaneously in society. For example, you have educational and remedial art, and all of these models have different languages.</p>\n<p>Around this period, I began <em>The Edinburgh Social Model Construction Project</em> (1973),* which was made in collaboration with four communities in that city. There was a group of five project operators in each area that went and knocked on people’s doors to introduce the project and distribute a problem sheet in the morning about the way people saw their environment and how they could change it. Around five o’clock each afternoon, they gathered all the sheets and took them to the ICL Centre to upload all the information into mainframe computers. Then the program looked for consensus tendencies within the information and the results were used to produce the following day’s problem situation which meant that we had a very quick series of feedback loops. This exercise lasted for a week, and it was starting to bring people together and to showcase consensus between the communities on how society could function.</p>\n<p>After this experience, we realized we could go further and we introduced the project to people passing by, more casual audiences that could intervene directly and add their own responses to the consensus tendencies that were created by a program within a computer terminal outside on the pavement of Princes Street. The computer looked pretty ugly by today’s standards, but people could appreciate and enjoy the unique experience of sitting down on a computer terminal on the street and, responding in a matter of seconds, the machine would start displaying the changes you had produced within the main consensus. This was a profound and powerful experience for people. I see this work as an interface between the analogue qualities of people’s lives and that of digital programming of social situations. The program was constructed by Stuart Pound who is a very famous programmer and concrete poet, and was also a member of CAS.</p>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> As a practitioner with expertise in the field of cybernetics, could you outline some of the key technologies and tools that have made your practice possible?</p>\n<p><strong>SW:</strong> In terms of technology, I did the physical fabrication of the works myself. Chris Grimshaw designed the circuits to my specifications, but then I had to solder them up on circuit boards. Over time, this experience made me an expert at doing this type of work. I was working with really good people, advanced thinkers of the time and marrying the language of their disciplines into the building of a responsive artwork and by doing so, creating a meta-language between the machine and human consciousness. The actual programming tended to be machine language and grey coding. When we came to <em>The Edinburgh Social Model Construction Project,</em> we used the programming language Fortran which relies on machine coding. So, we were actually building dedicated computers from scratch until the work <em>Free Zone</em> (1997) where we decided to use a general computer and we customized it by installing our own program of instructions.</p>\n<p>Financially, in the main, I funded the work myself. I did not want to institutionalize it because I always thought the artist should be free. When we did the work on social simulations, I spent many months working with local people and for most of these projects I set up advisory panels of experts from all sorts of disciplines like advertising, architecture, cybernetics, mathematics, philosophy and arts.</p>\n","length":3314,"title":"Interview: Stephen Willats","type":"essay","url":"https://vanda.github.io/vam-publications-hubs-nodes-and-networks/interview-stephen-willats/"},{"content":"<p>A history of any artistic movement can be read through the spaces that fostered it, and for digital art this is especially true. Inherently breaking new technical ground and operating outside traditional markets, the development of the UK digital art landscape has been reliant on a series of hubs, nodes and networks. Through a series of interviews with 16 artists and curators, this essay looks at the who, what, and where that allowed a national scene to thrive from the 1990s to the present.</p>\n<p>From grassroot instigators to institutional representatives, the individuals interviewed for this report present through their answers a picture of their personal experience within the field. At the same time it is important to highlight that while many of them are attached to specific art practices or movements, such as net art or media art, they do not necessarily call themselves digital artists or curators because the term is broad.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> The umbrella term ‘digital art’ is applied here in response to the V&amp;A’s Digital Art Collection, on which this research is based, and in order to bring together practitioners from different artistic backgrounds. The interviewees were Heath Bunting, Ruth Catlow (Furtherfield), Alison Craighead (Thomson &amp; Craighead), Sofia Crespo, Nina Davies, Marc Garrett (Furtherfield), Libby Heaney, Zaiba Jabbar (Hervisions), Keiken, Lawrence Lek, Irini Papadimitriou, Anna Ridler, Erica Scourti, Jon Thomson (Thomson &amp; Craighead), Nye Thompson and Kay Watson (Serpentine Galleries).</p>\n<p>The questionnaire employed here was designed to identify the hubs (spaces), nodes (individuals) and networks that were fundamental to the scenes from which their practices originated. These three elements are positioned within specific periods across each text to evoke particular moments, but in most cases the artists’ work spans decades into the present as well. Additionally, it is worth noting that more than 150 individuals, 40 spaces and 50 networks were mentioned in the responses, but owing to space limitations not all of them have been included. Therefore, this essay can be considered as a first and partial attempt at starting to understand the fundamental factors that have shaped the UK’s digital art ecology in the last three decades.</p>\n<p>Responding to the growing access to the internet, the 1990s saw the development of a new range of artistic hubs and networks that differed from the organisations of the 1970s and ‘80s. At a time when access to the internet was limited and expensive, venues such as Backspace (1996–9) in Clink Street, London, filled a void by providing an alternative to mainstream cybercafe commerce. Founded by six individuals, including James Stevens, Backspace provided ‘an open environment for exploration and expression on the Internet’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup>. Working with the space’s community, invited artists organized events now key to the UK net art scene, including the ‘ANTI WITH E’ lecture series (1997) and the ‘Expo Destructo, Post-Media Flea Market’ (1999), hosted on Charing Cross Road, London. Both events brought together an international community of hacktivists and creatives such as the artists Rachel Baker, Heath Bunting, Pete Gomes, Olia Lialina, Geert Lovink, Cornelia Sollfrank, Alexei Shulgin and the two UK-based collectives Mongrel and Thomson &amp; Craighead. The Arts Technology Centre (Artec) (1990–2001), located in Islington, London, was equally important as a point of access to technology. Established in 1990 with the support of the European Commission’s London Initiative,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup> Artec is known as the first centre for creative applications of digital technology in the UK. Its programme supported artists through residencies and commissions, in addition to delivering training courses for young and long-term unemployed people. Some of its early staff members include the producer Frank Boyd and the artists Derek Richards and Graham Harwood. From that appointment, Harwood went on to co-found the collective Mongrel (1995–2008)<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> with Artec students Richard Pierre-Davis and Mervin Jarman, alongside artist Matsumoto Yokokoji.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>Working more nomadically and founded both on and offline, artist-led organizations such as Furtherfield (1996–present), co-founded by artists Ruth Catlow and Marc Garrett, have been pivotal for reclaiming network technologies as tools for hacktivist critique and artistic collaborative practice. Catlow viewed the internet as a ‘hybrid machine-societal context for art making’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup> where objects could be shaped simultaneously by audiences and artists, moving away from the traditional view of artworks as objects owned and displayed in gallery spaces. Similarly, Garrett saw the internet as a means of ‘creating a shared imaginative context’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup> where people could learn new skills to collectively build a different reality. Their ethos echoed the sentiment of a generation of creatives that were eager to produce new distribution channels that could challenge the consumerist status quo of the mass media and its control over public space.</p>\n<p>At a time in which net art had little or no recognition within the institutional art establishment, these grassroot spaces were important in fuelling international collaboration and nurturing a creative community. Supporting all of this activity, a range of online networks formed through mailing lists and Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) to enable people to interact and share their activities. Examples include the World Wide Web Newsletter (1993–4) created by the technologist Ivan Pope at Goldsmiths College [Now Goldsmiths, University of London],<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup> and the cybercafe BBS (1994-96), run by the artists Rachel Baker, Heath Bunting and Marc Garret. Cybercafe was the forerunner of Furtherfield and the web server irational.org (1996–2006),<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup> which Bunting founded and invited artists Daniel G. Andújar, Rachel Baker, Kayle Brandon, Minerva Cuevas and Marcus Valentine to be part of. Other online key spaces for exchange and critique were <em>Mute</em> magazine (1994–present), founded by the artists Pauline van Mourik Broekman and Simon Worthington, and the Europe based mailing lists Nettime (1995–present), Syndicate (1996–2001) and Rhizome (1996–present).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">10</a></sup> The latter became an organization dedicated to born-digital art and affiliated in 2003 with the New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York.</p>\n<p>Mainstream art spaces responded to these activities too, for example Tate started a series of net artwork commissions (2000–12) with Graham Harwood’s <em>Uncomfortable Proximity</em> and Simon Patterson’s <em>Le Match des Couleurs</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">11</a></sup> Similarly, the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), London, opened its New Media Centre in 1998 and appointed curator Benjamin Weil as its director. Smaller organizations such as Merseyside Moviola,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">12</a></sup> which produced the UK’s largest international video-art festival Video Positive (1989–2000) in partnership with Tate Liverpool, formed into FACT Liverpool in 2003, an arts venue that has continued championing the presentation of emerging artists working with film and digital technology.</p>\n<p>Despite the growing institutional interest in digital art, most activities continued to be developed by independent organizations and artist-led spaces into the 2000s. Kay Watson, currently Head of Arts Technologies at Serpentine Galleries, London, highlights that ‘the community around artist-run spaces and experimental project spaces in London was key in the early 2000s and 2010s.’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fnref13\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">13</a></sup> Following the DIY (Do-it-Yourself) attitudes of rave culture in the UK in the 1990s,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">14</a></sup> experimental festivals dedicated to arts and digital culture emerged such as Futuresonic (1996–2009, now Future Everything) in Manchester;<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">15</a></sup> the DMZ Media Arts Festival taking place at Limehouse Town Hall, London (14–15 November 2003); NODE.London (2006–21); Abandon Normal Devices (2009–present) in Liverpool; Electromagnetic Field (2012–present) in Ledbury; and Mediale (2014–present), in York. These festivals have brought together an international community of artists and technologists, and were important in producing new languages with which to understand the post-internet digital condition.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">16</a></sup> They also served as sites of exchange where groups could raise awareness of how people could reclaim technologies despite the increasing corporatization of the internet. Irini Papadimitriou, currently Director of Exhibitions at Diriyah Art Futures, Riyadh, explains that the free and open-source software (FOSS)<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fnref17\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">17</a></sup> and collective prototyping culture present at these events were what inspired her to launch the V&amp;A’s Digital Design Weekend (2011–present)<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fnref18\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">18</a></sup>. Other relevant event-based networks that emerged during this period were Dorkbot London (2001–present),<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fnref19\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">19</a></sup> which has hosted more than 244 speakers over the years including artists Beatrice Gibson, Amy Alexander and Wojciech Kosma, and Algorave (2011–present),<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fnref20\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">20</a></sup> which has developed an expansive international network of practitioners including artist Ivan Abreu, composer Alexandra Cárdenas and AI and music researcher Norah Lorway. Dorkbot brought a community of creatives together to showcase work in progress, while Algorave combined sound and visual experimentations in live coding sessions.</p>\n<p>Complementing the creative networking opportunities generated through these events, online modes of dissemination maintained popularity. Key examples from this period are Furtherfield’s NetBehaviour (2003–present) and the Curatorial Resource for Upstart Media Bliss (CRUMB) (2000–24), founded by curators Sarah Cook and Beryl Graham. CRUMB was based at the University of Sunderland and as a mailing list it operated both as a critical space and a resource for practitioners interested in curating media art. Other universities followed suit in formalizing their support towards media practices: Goldsmiths, University of London, founded its MA Computational Arts programme in 2004 and Newcastle University opened its Culture Lab in 2006. These spaces have nurtured new generations of creatives and incentivized interdisciplinary approaches to digital technologies. Comparably, non-profit educational spaces such as Access Space (2000–present) in Sheffield, where artist Jake Harris has directed the Art &amp; Innovation programme since 2007, and London Hack Space (2009–present), founded by software engineers Russ Garrett and Jonty Wareing,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fnref21\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">21</a></sup> have been important venues to provide technological access and training outside of academic frameworks. Alongside those venues, NEoN Digital Arts (2009–present) in Dundee, directed by curator Donna Holford-Lovell, and Vivid Projects (2012–present) in Birmingham, originated by curator Yasmeen Baig-Clifford, have offered important skills-developed programming in addition to exhibitions and events.</p>\n<p>Following the post-internet turn, artists increasingly sought to express the material qualities of digital networks, driving a need for studios and artist-led spaces specializing in physically presenting media artworks to live audiences. Existing studio organization SPACE, in London, opened a programme titled Media Arts (2005–11), which was run by creative Gini Simpson (2003–8) and thanks to the curator Rachel Falconer (2013–6) developed other digitally focused strands of activity. Furthermore, arebyte Gallery (2013–present), founded by Nimrod Vardi, mixes studio complex and innovative digital art exhibitions, and Somerset House Studios (2015–present), founded by creative producer Marie McPartlin, would become a geographically central site of digital art thanks to its fabrication lab facilities and advisory services.</p>\n<p>Complementing the new type of studios mentioned above were artist-led galleries that created exhibition and screening opportunities in London. Examples include Lima Zulu (2000–16) in Manor House, co-run by curator Ben Vickers; Banner Repeater (2010–present) in Hackney Downs train station, founded by artist Ami Clarke; and Gossamer Fog (2016–present), founded by artist Samuel Capps in Deptford, which has recently launched a virtual production studio. At the same time, certain studios have also been key in incubating more spontaneous and inventive events, such as the series of Bring Your Own Beamer (BYOB) one-night exhibitions hosted by SPACE Media Arts in 2013 and 2017,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fnref22\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">22</a></sup> in which artists projected their interactive projects to an informal audience.</p>\n<p>Running in parallel to these various efforts, art institutions created new posts and launched more experimental programmes to present the work of artists exploring the social effects of network technology. Examples include the curated club nights organized by the ICA’s Director of Live and Digital, Vivienne Gaskin (1996–2006); the inaugural appointment of Katrina Sluis as Senior Curator of Digital Programmes at the Photographers’ Gallery (2011–9); the launch of the Open Data Institute’s (ODI) Data as Culture art programme (2014–present), directed by Hannah Redler Hawes;<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fnref23\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">23</a></sup> and Serpentine Galleries’ first digital commission <em>AGNES</em> (2014–9) by artist Cécile B. Evans,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fnref24\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">24</a></sup> which was overseen by Serpentine’s first digital art curator Ben Vickers, of Lima Zulu.</p>\n<p>Taking place alongside these in-person activities was the development of social-media platforms such as Facebook (2004), YouTube (2005), Tumblr (2007) and Instagram (2011). The popularity of these platforms amongst creatives grew rapidly due to their potential to serve as both a motif and medium for social critique, while working as sites for exhibitions and peer-to-peer exchange. From 2015, multiple online artistic platforms and networks emerged in the UK including Digital Artist Residency(2015–22),<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fnref25\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">25</a></sup> [ANTI]MATERIA(2016–present),<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fnref26\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">26</a></sup> Compiler (2016–present),<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fnref27\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">27</a></sup> isthisit? (2016–present),<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fnref28\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">28</a></sup> Skelf (2016–22),<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fnref29\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">29</a></sup> DRIVE-THRU (2017–8), Off Site Project (2017–present),<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fnref30\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">30</a></sup> Going Away TV (2019–21),<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fnref31\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">31</a></sup> Most Dismal Swamp (2019–present)<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fnref32\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">32</a></sup> and SPUR (2020–present).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fnref33\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">33</a></sup> Based in the UK, but with an international outreach, these platforms created a new space for an emerging generation of artists. Additionally, Hervisions (2015–present)<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fnref34\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">34</a></sup> and Digi-Gxl (2019–present)<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fnref35\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">35</a></sup> originated to support femme identify and non-binary artists specifically as a way to combat an historically male-dominated art scene. Overseas, the Wrong Biennale<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fnref36\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">36</a></sup> (2013–present), based in Spain, was a key international network established to motivate some of the above spaces to produce nomadic physical events and exhibitions, in addition to their online programmes. These activities motivated more established organizations to produce a consistent online programme to complement their onsite activities, for example the Photographers’ Gallery’s ‘Screen Walks’ series (2020–present), which was produced in collaboration with the Fotomuseum Winterthur, Switzerland; and arebyte Gallery’s open-call initiative ‘arebyte on Screen’ (2019–present).</p>\n<p>Finally, in the early 2010s London commercial galleries started to identify the potential of artistic practices dedicated to digital culture. Caroll/Fletcher (2012–7), founded by Jonathon Carroll and Steve Fletcher, and Gazelli Art House (2010–present), founded by Mila Askarova, are examples of galleries that have supported experimental practices and bridged between artists from different generations through consistent online and onsite programming. Around that period, the Lumen Prize for Art and Technology was founded by Carla Rapoport to recognize artists working with technologies and to raise awareness of their practices. More recently, with the rising interest in the blockchain and Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs), other types of commercial spaces such as VERSE.Works (2022–present) have emerged to develop a sales model that combines physical exhibitions and events with transactions on the blockchain. Similarly, through GAZELLI.iO (2015–present), Gazelli Art House has produced sales of artworks on the blockchain while developing residencies and dedicated project spaces for digital and virtual reality (VR) art. Lastly, other UK-based networks have formed to produce forums to discuss issues around ownership and the blockchain, for example the Digital Art Salon (2022–3) and Right Click Save Magazine (2022–present).</p>\n<p>By reflecting back on the past 30 years, it can be observed that the UK’s digital art ecology has four principal pillars of distinctive activity. The first is characterized by DIY community spaces such as Backspace, London Hack Space and Vivid Projects, which have provided access to technologies and training opportunities for creatives. These venues have encouraged a critical approach to technologies and generated informal research strategies. In the same way, at the time of writing, universities are developing programmes dedicated to more experimental prototyping and research – some examples are University College London’s new BA in Art and Technology; University of the Arts London’s Creative Computing Institute; Manchester Metropolitan University’s School of Digital Arts; and University of Plymouth’s PhD in Digital Art and Technology. The second pillar pertains to experimental exhibition spaces such as Furtherfield, Lima Zulu, arebyte Gallery, isthistit? and Somerset House Studios. These spaces allow artists to obtain necessary support to create new work and to generate peer-to-peer networks, in addition to pioneering inventive ways to present digital art practices to the general public. The third pillar comprises event-based communities exemplified by events and festivals such as Algorave, Abandon Normal Devices and Electromagnetic Field. These events are relevant to the aim of presenting emerging artistic practices to a wider audience and to enable artists to showcase their work within a more experiential and relaxed setting. The fourth pillar is formed of commercial spaces such as Caroll/Fletcher, Gazelli Art House and VERSE.works, which have been pivotal in establishing a market for digital artistic practices and supporting artists to factor in the legacy of their work. Atop these pillars sits institutional recognition, which has been essential to bringing these communities of practice to a wider audience.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Many artists prefer to be referred to simply as an artist, instead of falling within a specific categorization. <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Stevens, J.
