                    <em>Hubs, Nodes and Networks: A New History of British
                      Digital Art</em>, examines the spaces and people that enabled computational
                    and digital art in the twentieth and twenty first century
                    with the aim of representing the collective effort that has

                    Traditionally, art history has represented artistic
                    movements through the lens of masterpieces and their
                    creators. Less research has centred on the back-of-house
                    elements that have enabled creative individuals to develop
                    their work. One such element are the meeting spaces for
                    artistic communities, which have always been fundamental to
                    their development. Historic examples include the nightclub
                    Cabaret Voltaire, in Zurich, which was pivotal for Dada in
                    the 1910s, and the writer Gertrude Stein’s Parisian
                    apartment, a key place for Modernism in Europe during the
                    first half of the twentieth century. This research project,
                    titled
                    <em>Hubs, Nodes and Networks: A New History of British
                      Digital Art,</em>
                    re-examines the relevance of such spaces to the fostering of
                    computational and digital art in contemporary culture, as
                    well as the people behind them, with the aim of representing
                    the collective effort that has enabled this field of art to
                    succeed.

                    The term ‘digital art’ is applied across this research to
                    refer to artistic practices engaging conceptually and
                    technically with computational processes, in addition to
                    connecting the project with the V&amp;A’s Digital Art
                    Collection where the research stems from. The project
                    reviews the development of digital art in the United Kingdom
                    from the 1960s to the present day, focusing on three main
                    elements that have contributed to the formation of a
                    thriving digital art ecology in the region: artistic hubs,
                    nodes and networks. In the context of this project, ‘hubs’
                    have been defined as localities that could be physical or
                    digital, permanent or temporal, where individuals gather;
                    ‘nodes’ are individuals who produce connections and might be
                    affiliated with certain hubs or networks; and ‘networks’ are
                    the communities, declared or loosely correlated, that sit
                    across the hubs and nodes. Additionally, the research
                    considers as a baseline the V&amp;A’s Computer Arts Society
                    (CAS) Archive and Collection (1968–85) – a key resource to
                    understanding in depth the 1960s beginnings of digital art
                    in the UK and abroad. A major significance of the archive
                    and collection lies in the overview they provide of the
                    global networks that the society held with other
                    international communities, exploring the use of computers in
                    creative practice and how knowledge was exchanged in a
                    pre-internet era. Finding this type of notable content was
                    what inspired the project and drove an interest in
                    reflecting on the contemporary history of artistic networks
                    within the field of digital art.

                    CAS was founded in 1968 by the architect John Lansdown,
                    cybernetician George Mallen and engineer Alan Sutcliffe with
                    the purpose of ‘encouraging the creative use of computers in
                    the arts and allowing the exchange of information in this
                    area’.<sup><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-introduction-fn1" id="page-introduction-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup></sup>
                    The society was formed after the show ‘Cybernetic
                    Serendipity’, curated by Jasia Reichardt in 1968 at the
                    Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), London. Reichardt’s
                    exhibition demonstrated through the work of 130 artists and
                    scientists how post-war technologies could be applied for
                    creative purposes. Both Mallen and Sutcliffe were part of
                    the show. Mallen worked with the cybernetician Gordon Pask
                    to produce the work <em>The Colloquy of Mobiles</em> (1968),
                    while Sutcliffe took part with the composer Peter Zinovieff
                    and the Electronic Music Studios (EMS). The first iteration
                    of CAS, which is represented by the V&amp;A’s holdings, was
                    active from 1968 to ‘85 and developed workshops, events and
                    regular gatherings, in addition to generating exchange
                    through its <em>PAGE</em> bulletin, where international
                    exhibitions, events, resources, news, reviews and articles
                    were published and distributed to its members. By 1974, the
                    society had 192 members including the writer and systems
                    engineer Jonathan Benthall, cybernetic sculptor Edward
                    Ihnatowicz and Jasia Reichardt. Key to CAS’s global reach
                    were the networks based at Centro de Arte y Comunicación
                    (CAYC) (Buenos Aires), the New Tendencies Group (Zagreb) and
                    the group Experiments with Art and Technology (E.A.T.) at
                    Bell Laboratories (New Jersey). These groups are represented
                    in the V&amp;A’s collection through the work of such artists
                    as Eduardo Mac Entyre, Norma Tamburini, Marc Adrian, A.
                    Michael Noll and Lillian Schwartz.

                    This research project was developed using a mixed
                    methodological approach that sought to gather data on hubs,
                    nodes and networks in order to map the evolution of digital
                    art in the UK yet with an international perspective that
                    indicates how ideas have been globally exchanged. This
                    methodology includes conducting primary research in the
                    V&amp;A’s CAS Archive and Collection as well as in the Tate
                    archives, ZKM | Center for Art and Media archives and the
                    personal archive of Jasia Reichardt. The V&amp;A’s archive
                    is composed of 29 boxes. In addition to material related to
                    CAS activities, the archive contains memorabilia from
                    international exhibitions and events, John Lansdown and
                    George Mallen’s correspondence, newspaper cut-outs,
                    magazines, artist sketches and texts, and technological
                    brochures. Tate’s and the ZKM’s holdings expand on certain
                    artists, while Reichardt’s tracks her curatorial
                    interactions with many key figures in the field, both in the
                    UK and overseas. Research also included oral interviews with
                    five artists (1960s to ‘80s) whose stories are interwoven
                    with that of CAS and represented in the V&amp;A’s archive,
                    including Analivia Cordeiro, Ernest Edmonds, William Latham,
                    John Lifton and Stephen Willats. These extended
                    conversations were complemented by a programme of structured
                    interviews with representatives of the 1990s to 2020s that
                    featured qualitative and quantitative questions and were
                    carried out in a combination of digital surveys and direct
                    interviews. In this component, 16 artists and curators that
                    have contributed to the formation of the UK’s contemporary
                    digital art landscape were featured, including Heath
                    Bunting, Ruth Catlow (Furtherfield), Alison Craighead
                    (Thomson &amp; Craighead), Sofia Crespo, Nina Davies, Marc
                    Garrett (Furtherfield), Libby Heaney, Zaiba Jabbar
                    (Hervisions), Keiken, Lawrence Lek, Irini Papadimitriou,
                    Anna Ridler, Erica Scourti, Jon Thompson (Thomson &amp;
                    Craighead), Nye Thompson, and Kay Watson (Serpentine
                    Galleries). Data from the archives and the interviews was
                    identified, compiled and categorized in a data set to
                    determine which types of events and networks have enabled
                    the formation of digital art in the UK. The purpose of
                    understanding the history of digital art in this way is to
                    track and map directly from the data the relationships
                    between individuals and organisations. These data points
                    were systematically organized according to the roles of
                    individuals (e.g. artist, composer, curator), their networks
                    and work media (e.g. film, performance). An initial
                    visualisation model was then constructed with Dr Jin Gao,
                    Lecturer in Digital Archives, and Dr Bonnie Buyuklieva,
                    Lecturer in Data Science for Society, both from the
                    Department of Information Studies at University College
                    London. This way of mapping information links the subject
                    further to its conceptual framework on global nodal
                    connectivity and offers a new way of reading art history.

                    The first prototype of the data-visualization model
                    addresses the period from the 1960s to the ‘80s, when CAS
                    was active. This model reveals the key geographical
                    locations in the UK where international exchange was taking
                    place during this period. It also highlights the types of
                    practice that artists were focusing on and features the
                    individuals that created the global networks. Beyond this,
                    the model allows us to track the development of artistic
                    networks in the UK. This data-based reading of digital art
                    provides an alternative context to the traditional art
                    historical canon that presents artists as individual
                    geniuses and encourages one to recognize instead the
                    interdependencies of artistic practices. Moreover, it is an
                    interactive data-visualization model, making art history a
                    more tactile matter. The next step in this model is to chart
                    the relationships between practitioners of early generations
                    to artists of the 1990s to the 2020s. A continued enquiry of
                    this type into the present might help to show connections
                    between the period of computational art which is covered
                    here and the contemporary period that this project is yet to
                    map.

                    Analivia Cordeiro (b. 1954, Brazil) is an artist, dancer and
                    choreographer known for her trailblazing video and computer
                    art. At only 19 years old, Cordeiro programmed the computer
                    dance <em>M3X3</em> (1973) which was presented for the first
                    time at the ‘INTERACT. Man: Machine: Society’ exhibition and
                    conference, organized by the Computer Arts Society for the
                    Edinburgh International Festival. This work and supporting
                    materials are part of the V&amp;A’s Digital Art Collection.

                    <strong>Pita Arreola:</strong> Reflecting on the beginning
                    of your career, could you elaborate on your earliest
                    encounters with computer art and how you came to incorporate
                    certain methodologies and technologies into your practice?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Analivia Cordeiro:</strong> When I presented my work
                    <em>M3x3</em> in 1973, I was only 19 years old. I did not
                    have any formal training or academic links to the field of
                    technology. I learned how to program computers through
                    books. More importantly, I was a professional dancer. I have
                    been dancing since I was seven years old. This has given me
                    a complex understanding of the vocabulary and language of
                    body movements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1973, my life radically changed when my father, the
                    artist Waldemar Cordeiro, passed away unexpectedly in his
                    sleep at the age of 48. But I continued my work and in
                    August that year, I premiered <em>M3x3</em> at the
                    ‘INTERACT. Man: Machine: Society’* exhibition and conference
                    which was part of the Edinburgh International Festival. I
                    did not attend the event, but I sent the film by post with
                    the paper 'A Language for Dance’ (1973) which is part of the
                    V&amp;A collection. The architect John Lansdown presented
                    the paper and the film on my behalf at the conference.

                  <p>
                    During 1974, I was invited to be part of a seminar for the
                    Art and Science programme at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and
                    Design in Jerusalem which was organized by the cybernetician
                    and computer artist Vladimir Bonačić. It was an interesting
                    experience because I was by far the youngest person
                    attending. I met the artist John Whitney who was 72 at that
                    time and became friends with the artist Herbert Franke. His
                    English was not good and mine was worse, but we developed a
                    nice friendship. When I came back to Brazil, we exchanged
                    letters, and communicating by post took months of course.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I also had a very good relationship with the cybernetician
                    Gordon Pask. He was a very intelligent person with a
                    flexible mind. I had dinner at his house, and we talked
                    about education. I only met John Lansdown once and we did
                    not have the time to discuss culture, but in 1977 he wrote a
                    paper about computers and choreography, and he mentioned my
                    practice as an example of pioneering work.**
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>PA:</strong> Since early on in your career, you have
                    taken part in different events and exhibitions such as
                    ‘INTERACT. Machine: Man: Society’ (1973), organized by the
                    Computer Arts Society (CAS) for the Edinburgh International
                    Festival; the ‘Latin America 74’ exhibition at the Institute
                    of Contemporary Art (ICA), London (1973); and the ‘Art and
                    Science’ programme at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and
                    Design, Jerusalem (1974). Could you tell us about these and
                    other events that were both memorable and important in
                    establishing the circle that your practice originates from,
                    or that further raised the profile of your community of
                    practice?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>AC:</strong> I was somewhat isolated in Brazil. I
                    had little money after my father’s death, so I couldn’t
                    travel much. I travelled intellectually, but not physically.
                    But in a way, I had many freedoms in my work because I was
                    not connected to a university or company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Those exhibitions, especially ‘INTERACT. Machine: Man:
                    Society’<em>,</em> were fundamental for my career. I was
                    very young when I sent my proposal to CAS, but they accepted
                    it and sent me an invitation to be part of the exhibition by
                    post. I took the letter to the broadcaster TV Cultura in
                    Brazil and asked them for support. The director was
                    astonished that I had received an invitation to present my
                    work at an international arts festival. It took some
                    convincing, but she agreed to speak to the committee and
                    after 10 days they confirmed their support. Without Lansdown
                    and the exhibition, I would have never been able to develop
                    <em>M3x3</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For the recording of this video, a computer generated the
                    instructions to assemble the scenes, so the TV director did
                    not have much work to do. The dancers were aware of how to
                    direct their movements towards the cameras positioned at the
                    front, top and sides of the stage. For the final edition, I
                    asked them to use a high contrast of black and white, so the
                    images could aesthetically respond to computer binaries, 0s
                    and 1s, as well as merge the body with the scene. They were
                    reluctant at first, but they ended up accepting my request.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After that, I met Jorge Glusberg, director of Centro de Arte
                    y Comunicación (CAyC), in Buenos Aires. He selected the work
                    of artists, including mine, and presented it in New York and
                    across Europe in countries like Italy, Belgium and France,
                    and in London at the ICA. These exhibitions raised awareness
                    of the exchanges between art and technology and presented
                    the aesthetic propositions of a collective of artists. CAS
                    and CAyC cemented the foundations of today’s digital art
                    practices. I was very lucky to be part of those groups.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> Around the period these events took
                    place, the early 1970s, what specific vocabulary was being
                    used to describe digital art? It would be good to hear about
                    that, considering how terminologies have been used and
                    changed across different periods.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>AC:</strong> At the beginning there were two main
                    terms: ‘computer art’ and ‘computer-aided art’. Computer art
                    applied to works where the output was directly generated by
                    the computer, like a plotter drawing. Computer-aided art
                    described work where the computer produced the instructions
                    for humans to translate and execute. In this type of art
                    form, the final artwork is the human interpretation. Over
                    time, the latter term disappeared; we don’t have a
                    distinction any more between computer- and human-decoded
                    outputs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My work also included video, which fell under ‘multimedia
                    art’, a term that came after ‘computer art’. Gradually, the
                    whole movement evolved into a moment when it was called ‘art
                    and technology’. Nowadays, everybody uses technology. The
                    term ‘digital’ sits in opposition to ‘analogue’, and at this
                    point in time the analogue seems Palaeolithic and has
                    disappeared. ‘Digital art’ emerges from computer art and
                    should be used to describe artists who are really
                    questioning the relationship between humans and technology.
                    Using digital tools is not enough anymore. We are now
                    immersed in technology and unable to experience reality
                    without technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, our visual capacity changes over time. It
                    relies on the stimuli we receive and our physiology. We see
                    things differently than we used to see them last century.
                    Today, there are two prominent phenomena that contemporary
                    art should address. The first is the constancy of change,
                    and the second is the excessive abundance of visual imagery.
                    In my view, what matters today is not the individual
                    artwork, but the visual structure that it proposes.
                    ‘Generative art’ produces thousands of examples of the same
                    visual structure, and each example is a variation of this
                    structure. In this type of work, the audience’s role shifts
                    from selecting a specific artwork to rationally
                    understanding the visual structure because it is very
                    difficult to choose one image since they all seem similar,
                    but each one is different from the other. The images appear
                    similar but they are never the same.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Digital art is no longer sufficient to address this type of
                    art, and it could be called instead ‘post-digital art’ which
                    could also be described as ‘probabilistic’ or ‘structural
                    digital art’. Probability here refers to rapid and constant
                    change. This attitude can be defined as a ‘quantum posture’,
                    where things are in continuous flux, passing through a
                    position for a fraction of a second and we are only able to
                    perceive and experience their constant change. To create
                    work in this context means that images are constantly being
                    generated and their physical representation is the structure
                    in time. Because of this, time is central to the concept of
                    structural art. I’m trying to explain here what will be
                    implicit in future works of art that will originate from
                    ‘computer art’ that existed 60 years ago.

                  <p>
                    Future spectators will be challenged to understand and
                    visually absorb this structure, but visualisation is
                    changing, and we will change. People will need more accuracy
                    to understand and memorize similar images.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> Over the years, you have collaborated
                    with different individuals across the UK and
                    internationally, including Vladimir Bonačić, John Lansdown
                    and Nilton Lobo. Could you tell us about these
                    collaborations and the expertise they have brought to your
                    practice?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>AC:</strong> As I mentioned, Lansdown was
                    fundamental: his invitation to ‘INTERACT’ and the
                    collaboration that generated was what brought me into this
                    world. Before him, I met Bonačić. He came to Brazil in 1971
                    for the exhibition ‘Arteônica’ that my father organized in
                    São Paulo. I was then a first-year student at the
                    Architecture and Urbanism College at the University of São
                    Paulo. During his visit, I showed him mathematical visual
                    studies that I had done utilizing lines and dots. He then
                    introduced me to the concept of random choice which was
                    shaping the aesthetic of that moment and was very important
                    for programming my work. These ideas helped me consider how
                    to program my choreographies defining the different body
                    positions.

                    I went to New York in 1977 and studied under the dancer and
                    choreographer Merce Cunningham. After that, I came back to
                    Brazil and developed the second phase of my work dedicated
                    to the notation of movement. It is unbelievable but still
                    today there is not an established efficient and easy method
                    to write movements like we have with music. Over the years,
                    dance history has been lost because of this reason. At that
                    point, I was looking for a collaborator and went to the
                    University of São Paulo. In January 1983, the director of
                    the Computer Science Department introduced me to the
                    engineer Nilton Lobo. We began our collaboration, and we got
                    married in 1993. We now have a son who is part of our family
                    research unit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first thing that I have to say is that I consider Nilton
                    a co-author, because technical experts not only support the
                    work, but they also shape the work with their perspective.
                    They give the work future possibilities. I believe all
                    artists should consider technicians as co-authors.

                    In the beginning, I had a vision of programming human
                    movement into the computer. The work we have done is
                    pioneering motion capture, as there was nothing available to
                    do this before. To be a pioneer means that you find ways to
                    transform ideas that do not exist into reality. Through our
                    research on trajectory notation, I studied the single frames
                    of a film and identified 24 joints of the body’s limbs per
                    frame. The video contained 30 frames per second and this
                    exercise produced thousands of body movements. Nilton made
                    the program that transformed that information into 2D
                    figures that we used to generate 3D computer figures. This
                    whole process resulted in a motion-capture system called
                    Nota-Anna.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> Beyond networks of digital art that
                    we’ve mentioned, you’ve also circulated amongst communities
                    of dance. Could you tell us about how these differ or what
                    they bring?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>AC:</strong> I have always considered myself a
                    dancer. Dance communities are very distinct from others
                    because we have a strict lifestyle. To be a dancer is like
                    being an athlete. We are very disciplined. We are not able
                    to go out at night and get drunk, because the next morning
                    we cannot work well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>PA:</strong> As a practitioner with expertise in the
                    fields of algorithmic choreography and architecture of
                    movement, could you outline some of the key technologies and
                    tools that have made your practice possible?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>AC:</strong> I mostly use video in my work. At the
                    beginning, I did not have a plotter, so I drew by hand the
                    six numbers of a vector that represent the body position in
                    the printed output of the computer dance. I used plotters
                    when they became available. Then later, the operating system
                    Windows, which I found to be great because you could store
                    different information and it gave you the ability to
                    multitask. The internet changed everything and gave us the
                    opportunity to communicate with more people. When video was
                    integrated into the internet, the space became a paradise.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In terms of software, Photoshop created great freedom and
                    QuickTime allowed the editing process in video to become
                    home-made. These technological tools empowered individuals
                    but people have become slaves to the technology. I am not
                    driven by technology. I use it when it makes sense to me. I
                    have incorporated all the new technologies into my work
                    because it made the research easier and because of the
                    possibilities it opened to develop our first dream of
                    finding a way to write and create movement. Today, the
                    challenge for people is to find a personal space that allows
                    them to express themselves. Technology obliges us to follow
                    too many rules to communicate, we should have more space to
                    find our personal way of communicating.

                  <p>
                    <strong>PA:</strong> It would be interesting to hear about
                    the thinkers and theoretical concepts that have helped shape
                    your work.

                    <strong>AC:</strong> Historically, Brazil was not a
                    technology driven country, but I had my father. When he was
                    alive, he gave me access to information and books about
                    computer art and theorists like the engineer and philosopher
                    Abraham Moles. These ideas provided me with a clear
                    direction to understand technological contexts and my place
                    within them. Another theorist is Jonathan Benthall from the
                    ICA, London, who had a very unique and humanistic
                    perspective about technology and culture. His book
                    <em>Science and Technology in Art Today</em> (1972) was very
                    influential for the field.

                    Additionally, I had a very special education with the
                    choreographer Maria Duschenes under the Rudolf Laban dance
                    method. Laban was a theoretician who analyzed the language
                    of human body movement through its elements and established
                    the relationship between those elements. He was very
                    important to my work, because this method allowed me to
                    understand body movements in order to program them on the
                    computer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another influential figure was the artist, designer and
                    choreographer Oskar Schlemmer, who was a tutor at the
                    Bauhaus. I love his work. One day, Mrs Duschenes took us to
                    see the film of his <em>Triadic Ballet</em> from 1922 at the
                    Goethe Institut, in São Paulo, and I started intuitively
                    learning from his work by dancing and imitating the movement
                    of his dancers. When I was 12, I also met the artist John
                    Cage, and Merce Cunningham. These artistic experiences and
                    my research drove me to seek new aesthetics. I think that a
                    new media requires a new aesthetic. You can see these new
                    languages of video and body movements in my three videos
                    <em>M3x3</em>, <em>0=45°</em> (1974)* and
                    <em>Cambiantes</em> (1976).

                    <strong>PA:</strong> Finally, could you speak about the
                    conceptual framework of your work and how it has evolved

                  <p>
                    <strong>AC:</strong> The goal of computer art in the 1970s
                    was to establish a dialogue between technology and society.
                    Computers represented a bright future for a new society that
                    would be more egalitarian, with people having more free
                    time. It is not exactly what happened, or is not our reality
                    today, but the energy was very positive. Artists were trying
                    to understand how to translate the language of arts into a
                    computer. In my case, I was looking for ways to translate
                    elements of choreography and body expression so these could
                    be programmed by a computer. Nowadays, we have the opposite
                    problem, we need to take people’s activities away from
                    computers.

                    Artists were part of a counter-culture movement and many
                    questions that emerged during that time are still relevant
                    and unresolved today. Counter-culture was very important,
                    and it is something that the group exhibition ‘Coded: Art
                    Enters the Computer Age’ (2023) at Los Angeles County Museum
                    of Art showcased very successfully. This movement was killed
                    by big corporations like IBM and Siemens who started to pay
                    artists to create with their products.

                    At first glance, you can think that I was trying to solve
                    practical problems of how to coordinate the video camera
                    with human movement in dance production. That was one of the
                    objectives of my early research, but the second phase
                    focused on how to write body movements. Behind these
                    practical problems there is deeper research concerning the
                    future of humans and the behaviour of humans with
                    technology. In <em>M3x3</em> I approached this question by
                    establishing body positions through notational figures. The
                    dancers then learnt the positions and created the link
                    between the positions in order to produce the choreography.
                    In this way, the dancers were emotionally involved by making
                    individual decisions on the movements and could express
                    themselves creating the transitions between positions. I
                    never saw the dancer in this process as an animation or an
                    avatar.

                    Nowadays, the challenge for younger generations is how to
                    exist and express themselves individually in the middle of
                    the infinite stream of rules that manage our daily lives.
                    For example, today you must fit all your messages inside the
                    rectangular shape of screens, otherwise you lose them. This
                    is a big limitation for our brain. If I owned a technology
                    company, I would invent and distribute screens in round,
                    square and polygonal shapes, so people could be freer to
                    feed their ideas to the screen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another element that is important to my work is spontaneity:
                    I always propose to people to act as they feel in their own
                    time, which gives them the freedom to find their own
                    possibilities. This idea was presented in my show ‘From Body
                    to Code’ (2023) at ZKM (Center for Art and Media, Karlsruhe)
                    where we had motion-capture works that proposed to people
                    ways to find their own pace and movements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A final element of my work is the relationship between
                    humans and their surroundings. In my first work
                    <em>M3x3</em>, I merged the human body with the scene as a
                    way to signify that we are one with nature. This is an idea
                    that I applied to succeeding artworks. Through my work, I
                    invite the audience not to oppose the environment but to
                    work with it. Some people destroy the environment for
                    profit, but there is a limit to what money can provide if we
                    don’t have a proper natural world.

                    Ernest Edmonds (b. 1942, United Kingdom) is an artist
                    recognized as an early innovative figure of computer art.
                    Underpinned by the Concrete and Constructivist traditions,
                    his practice investigates how human perception and cognitive
                    processes evolve over time within exchanges between humans
                    and technological systems. Edmonds’ interactive work
                    <em>Shaping Forms 14/07/2007</em> (2007) demonstrates these
                    ideas and is part of the V&amp;A’s Digital Art Collection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Pita Arreola:</strong> Reflecting on the beginning
                    of your career, could you elaborate on your earliest
                    encounters with computer art and how you came to incorporate
                    certain methodologies and technologies into your practice?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Ernest Edmonds:</strong> I decided that I wanted to
                    be an artist when I was a schoolboy, but the art schools of
                    that day were not helpful for what I wanted to do. My
                    friends that had gone to art school were not very
                    enthusiastic about it. Long story short, I decided to do a
                    mathematics degree which I found easy, so I had lots of time
                    to paint. When I studied at the University of Leicester, the
                    head of mathematics was a brilliant logician, so I got into
                    logic. He introduced me to philosophy, and I ended up
                    interested in the philosophy of mathematics and went to do a
                    PhD in logic at the University of Nottingham, submitted in
                    1973. The branch of logic that I was concerned with was
                    computation, so that helped me understand the logical
                    underpinning of computer science and Alan Turing’s work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That is my background, but to answer your question, in 1967
                    I took a job as a research assistant in mathematics at what
                    soon became the Leicester Polytechnic [now De Montfort
                    University]. One year into my project, I noticed that we had
                    a computer, so I decided to play with it and taught myself
                    to program. I found that I could write programs to solve
                    issues that were helpful for the research I was doing in
                    logic. My research assistantship was uncertain as it had to
                    be renewed yearly, and the head of the department told me
                    about a lectureship in computing that would be a more
                    permanent role, so I became a computer scientist by
                    accident. I tried to do something that was interesting to
                    me, and started applying computers to art and design. But in
                    those days you could not say that you were doing computer
                    art, because people would be dismissive, so I tried to label
                    it all as ‘design support’.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>PA:</strong> Previously you commented on computer
                    art having antecedents in other artistic movements, such as
                    Constructivism and Concrete art. It would be good to hear
                    your thoughts on that. I know, for example, that
                    Constructivism has been very influential on your work and
                    thinking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>EE:</strong> Without question,** I consider that the
                    Constructivist tradition was really the artistic direction
                    that led to what we are discussing now and if you read the
                    writings of the people at the University of Stuttgart from
                    the 1960s, you’ll see that this tradition was very
                    influential. If we look at the UK scene in the 1940s, it
                    turned out to be crucial because there was a group of
                    artists before computers that were applying procedures to
                    make their art. In particular, the artists Kenneth and Mary
                    Martin and others around them. They devised the procedure
                    that generated the art. The physical appearance of the
                    artwork wasn’t something that the artist decided, the
                    aesthetics emerged from decisions about the procedures.
                    Kenneth once said to me that he wished he was younger
                    because then he could have used computers.

                    Following those artists, a group, including some of their
                    students, formed the Systems Group. The ‘Systems’ exhibition
                    (1972) at Whitechapel Gallery, curated by Nicholas Serota,
                    featured the work of the group and toured across the UK
                    including to Leicester. These artists often used mathematics
                    and geometry as the baseline for their work. The artists
                    Malcolm Hughes and Jeffrey Steele were key in putting
                    together the group. In a way, their work was directly
                    leading towards using software for making art and it is
                    important to note the vision
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    they had. Jeffrey was lecturing at Portsmouth Polytechnic
                    and proposed in the late 1960s buying a computer for the Art
                    Department but failed to persuade them. However, a few years
                    later, Malcolm succeeded in convincing the Slade School of
                    Fine Art, in London, to buy a computer. Neither Malcolm nor
                    Jeffrey were computer programmers, but they thought this was
                    important for the future. Malcolm started the Experimental
                    Department at the Slade in 1972.

                    During the 1960s, there were many events across the world
                    that catalyzed the use of computers in the arts. In 1965,
                    the mathematician George Nees and computer scientist Frieder
                    Nake presented their computer art in the exhibition
                    ‘computer grafik’ at the University of Stuttgart. That year,
                    the Howard Wise Gallery in New York showed the work of the
                    neuroscientist Béla Julesz and engineer A. Michael Noll in
                    the exhibition ‘Computer-Generated Pictures’. From the UK
                    point of view, Jasia Reichardt organized the *‘*Cybernetic
                    Serendipity’ show at the Institute of Contemporary Arts
                    (ICA) in London during 1968. Before that, she had met the
                    philosopher Max Bense who taught at the University of
                    Stuttgart, and proposed that the future were computers. The
                    Computer Arts Society (CAS) was also formed in August that
                    year.

                    In terms of my own work, at that time I was moving from
                    making art that was about abstractions to the abstract. By
                    abstractions, I mean using elements like landscapes or
                    flowers, whereas in the abstract work, I was interested in
                    more geometric and minimalistic forms of the Constructivist
                    tradition. In 1968, I had just taught myself how to write
                    computer programs. I decided to make an artwork that
                    summarized what I had been doing in the previous ten years.
                    The work is titled <em>Nineteen</em> (1968–9) and it is
                    composed of 20 square reliefs. I was finding it difficult to
                    decide how to arrange the composition. I realized that I
                    could write down the rules and use them to write a computer
                    program to work out the arrangement. It turned out that it
                    was practically difficult to do this, because Leicester
                    Polytechnic only had one computer. But I managed to get
                    three hours with the computer to run my program and find a
                    solution.

                  <p>
                    I wanted to use spray paint to apply colour in my
                    compositions to avoid brush marks. I was looking for help to
                    do this and crossed the road to the Art Department where I
                    found the artist Stroud Cornock in charge of a spray booth.
                    He helped me with the painting but he was more interested in
                    the fact that I was using a computer program to work out the
                    compositional arrangement. He had previously been working
                    with the artist Roy Ascott and was inspired by these new
                    technologies. After that, we became good friends and
                    collaborators.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> I know you worked with Stroud Cornock
                    on several projects, including <em>DataPack</em> (1970).
                    Could you tell us about this collaboration and the
                    development it brought to your practice?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>EE:</strong> In 1969, Stroud and I wrote the paper
                    ‘The Creative Process Where the Artist is Amplified or
                    Superseded by the Computer’<em>,</em> which we saw as a
                    manifesto. We presented it in 1970 and it was published in
                    the journal <em>Leonardo</em> in 1973. One of our key points
                    was that the future of art with computers would be
                    interactive. This was before the personal computer. That
                    year, 1970, we had the opportunity to show
                    <em>DataPack</em> in the ‘Computer Graphics 70’ exhibition.
                    They hosted the show alongside the conference, and we
                    thought it would be an ideal space to present the type of
                    interactive artwork we proposed in our paper presented at
                    that conference. We designed and built the piece. It would
                    not look too exciting today, but it was what was possible
                    with the technology of that time. It demonstrated the
                    potential of interactive art where you turned the audience
                    into a participatory element of the creative process and
                    gave them agency to influence the work.
                    <em>DataPack</em> used a teletype allowing typed data to be
                    sent to a computer. The participants used the teletype to
                    have a ‘conversation’ with the computer. The computer
                    program I wrote used the data from the conversation to draw
                    an image in response to the individual interaction utilizing
                    a graph plotter which operated a pen, a drawing machine,
                    much different from the typical printers we have nowadays.
                    The images were produced using data from the plans of the
                    Vickers building [now known as the Millbank Tower], next to
                    Tate Modern. The program allocated space inside or around
                    the building based on the conversation. The work was called
                    <em>DataPack</em> because we gave each participant a plastic
                    folder with a copy of their dialogue and the image that was
                    generated especially for them.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> Can you tell me about your work
                    <em>Communications Games</em> (1971) from around that time?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>EE:</strong> I was very interested in the fact that
                    the computer provided me with new ideas and ways to make
                    art. I did not think of it as a tool, but as a new medium
                    that opened opportunities to look at new art forms. I was
                    also interested in psychology and systems theory. For
                    <em>Communications Game</em>, I started to investigate
                    psychology and to learn about language, communication
                    methods and behaviour. In this work, I saw the opportunity
                    to produce a networked experience where several people could
                    interact with one another through the artwork. It was before
                    the internet, so I designed an electronic circuit which I
                    physically assembled to produce a network of six stations
                    for the participants. The challenge of just using lights and
                    switches for the interactions was to enable it to feel
                    meaningful rather than random. I built later versions for
                    exhibitions in 1973 and beyond. Later versions were shown,
                    for example, in 1990 in ‘Art Creating Society’ at what used
                    to be called the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, and in 2015
                    in ‘Primary Codes’ at Oi! Futuro, Rio de Janeiro.

                  <p>
                    <strong>PA:</strong> Do you consider some of these ideas to
                    be applicable to more recent interactive works, such as
                    <em>Shaping Form</em> (2007), which is in the V&amp;A’s
                    Digital Art Collection?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>EE:</strong> Looking back at the early days, we
                    considered interaction in relation to systems theory and
                    biology, where an interaction can change internal states as
                    well as direct behaviour. However, by the early 2000s most
                    interactive art was based on action response, which is more
                    related to game models. Contradicting this trend, I decided
                    that I wanted to make artworks that dealt with the first
                    type of interaction, so I started the
                    <em>Shaping Form</em> series (2007–12). These works are
                    composed of two main parts. The first one is a camera, which
                    detects movement, connected to a computer (some versions can
                    pick up on sound or other aspects of the environment). And
                    the second one is a screen that presents the audience with a
                    generative visual experience, including a response to their
                    presence. The work at the V&amp;A was the first one I did.
                    The main principle of the work is that the computer keeps
                    track of the movement, and in response, it is constantly
                    readjusting the rules that generate the image sequence. It
                    is a rule-based generative work which can produce an
                    infinite number of different arrangements of shapes and
                    colours, evolving as a result of participant interaction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    More recently, I have been working on extensions of
                    <em>Communications Game</em>, utilizing the internet and
                    ideas from <em>Shaping Form</em>: <em>the</em>
                    <em>Cities Tango</em> series. For example, in 2021, I
                    developed a piece for the British Pavilion in the Dubai Expo
                    that connected that space with the streets of Leicester. I
                    used cameras and screens to create one station in each
                    location, so people from Dubai could interact with the
                    people in Leicester through colour and images. In this work,
                    the audience keeps influencing the work as the program
                    continues to learn and evolve over time. Most of my recent
                    work links interactive art with communication technologies.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> Conceptually, artificial intelligence
                    has played an important role in your work, and you have
                    written extensively about this topic. These themes can be
                    found in the <em>Shaping Form</em> series and in your
                    collaborative work with the cognitive scientist Margaret A.
                    Boden. It would be fantastic to hear more about this
                    collaboration.

                  <p>
                    <strong>EE:</strong> Artificial intelligence (AI) is
                    integral to much of my work; even just the analysis of
                    people’s movement is using AI techniques, and the
                    evolutionary aspect of the work relates to AI in a bigger
                    sense. I do not just mean machine learning, in the modern
                    world these concepts often get confused.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I have expanded on this work and collaborated with other
                    people interested in the topic, such as Margaret Boden. In
                    2019, Maggie and I published the book
                    <em>From Fingers to Digits. An Artificial Aesthetic</em> to
                    address the use of software and AI in computer art. We first
                    met in a remote and lovely place in Australia, Lamington
                    National Park, where we both presented at a conference on
                    creativity. We frequently talked. She came and spent time in
                    Australia with me, and I often went to Sussex where she was
                    professor of cognitive science at the university. We had a
                    very strong mutual interest in creativity and AI. I was
                    interested in amplifying human creativity and Maggie was
                    interested in modelling creativity, so we started to do some
                    writing together. In 2009, we published an article ‘What Is
                    Generative Art?’* in the
                    <em>Digital Creativity</em> journal,* and we decided to
                    write a book together. It took a long time, but you can see
                    in that 2019 publication that we agreed on many issues
                    related to AI. We were part of the same circle. Although she
                    is not an artist, she was very closely connected with the
                    art world. We had many friends in common, including the
                    artist Harold Cohen. She is really a philosopher, although
                    she is more famously known as a cognitive scientist. In her
                    writing, you can see how she has applied her interest in
                    philosophy to computer science.

                  <p>
                    Apart from AI, colour is another key element in my work. I
                    found that with computing I was able to build computational
                    systems that controlled colour. When I worked at
                    Loughborough University in the 1990s, some of my colleagues
                    were researching colour for commercial purposes and working
                    with companies such as Marks &amp; Spencer to establish
                    computational methods that dealt with how colour was
                    perceived. And I was able to draw from this research and
                    start looking at colour computationally from a perceptual
                    psychology perspective.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> Throughout your career, you have been
                    part of groups and social organizations within and beyond
                    the UK that have contributed to the development of the
                    digital arts, for example CAS. Could you talk about these
                    and other digital-art communities in the UK and globally
                    that have been influential to the development of your
                    practice?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>EE:</strong> Stroud Cornock and I formed an informal
                    group in Leicester towards the end of the 1960s and brought
                    in various active artists from elsewhere. But the first
                    formal organization that I joined was CAS and, in fact,
                    Stroud and I gave a talk at one of their 1970 meetings about
                    what we were doing in Leicester. CAS has been an important
                    community, both nationally and internationally. I have
                    already mentioned <em>Leonardo</em>. The community
                    associated with that journal has been, and still is, an
                    important one; enabling publications, encouraging debate and
                    interchange. Art communities that I belonged to that took a
                    serious interest in the use of computers without focusing on
                    it included Exhibiting Space, a London artist-led group
                    initiated by the artist Ray Thomson, and the PRO Foundation
                    based in the Netherlands and led by artist and curator Fré
                    Ilgen. These two communities originated very interesting
                    dialogues between artists using computers and others who
                    worked in the Constructivist tradition, often employing
                    mathematics. The first International Symposium on Electronic
                    Art was held in Utrecht in 1988 and I contributed to it.
                    This led to a series of regular symposia, with the shortened
                    title of ISEA International, that still operates today and
                    had formed a significant community, overlapping with CAS. It
                    is run by a formal foundation with a legal base in the
                    Netherlands. Another community, which is strongly
                    multi-disciplinary and includes computer scientists,
                    cognitive scientists and others interested in creativity as
                    well as computer-based artists, is based on the Association
                    for Computing Machinery’s (ACM) Creativity and Cognition
                    (C&amp;C) conference series, which I founded in 1993 with
                    Linda Candy. As with ISEA, this is also lively today.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>PA:</strong> We talked about your early
                    collaboration with Stroud Cornock, but your involvement with
                    these communities must have led to other partnerships.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>EE:</strong> Yes, very much so. I have often
                    collaborated, sometimes technically, with other artists. For
                    example, on performances with Mark Fell, whose work is
                    grounded in electronic music, and on distributed interaction
                    with Sean Clark, who currently chairs CAS. There have been
                    many others, including PhD students who are often as much
                    collaborators as students. I am currently working with
                    Jonathan Knoblauch, who is an expert on quantum computing.
                    All these collaborations help to keep moving on. And the
                    communities I mentioned are also still important to me. We
                    still have CAS, <em>Leonardo</em>, ISEA, C&amp;C and other
                    groups pressing ahead as communities advancing the
                    computer-based arts. Of course, all of these are specialist
                    groups. In the UK, the V&amp;A recognized, and started
                    collecting, computer-based art quite some time ago, but
                    public bodies have mostly been slow to follow that lead.
                    However, we can now see significant examples of integration
                    into the mainstream, both in the commercial and the public
                    sectors.

                    William Latham (b. 1961, United Kingdom) is a visual artist,
                    computer scientist and computer games designer who applies
                    evolutionary theory to art making. He is well known for his
                    work <em>Mutator</em> (1989–present), an evolutionary
                    software system that generates variations of organic life in
                    3D forms. Early iterations of <em>Mutator</em> can be found
                    in his works created at IBM –
                    <em>Colid Horn (Twist 5)</em> (1987), <em>Tube 1</em> (1987)
                    and <em>Twister 1</em> (1988) – which are part of the
                    V&amp;A’s Digital Art Collection.

                    <strong>Pita Arreola:</strong> Could we begin with your
                    earliest encounters with digital art and how you came to
                    incorporate certain methodologies and technologies into your
                    practice?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>William Latham:</strong> I grew up in a village near
                    the Harwell Atomic Research Centre, in Oxfordshire. My
                    family and all our friends were scientists who worked there
                    using software, computers and, of course, mathematics. This
                    had a big influence on me. Right from the start, I was
                    thinking about technology and molecular diagrams. My father
                    was an industrial chemist, so I was very familiar with
                    molecular imagery and that set me in a particular direction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When I went to the Ruskin School of Art at the University of
                    Oxford in 1979, the students were fortunate enough to be
                    allowed to explore the various departments, so I would go
                    and work in the Physics Department and also the Computer
                    Department.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It was at the Oxford University Computing Department that I
                    first came across and used plotters and programming in
                    Fortran 77. I started then to be aware of what was happening
                    in the software space, particularly with artificial
                    intelligence (AI) systems, like ELIZA. Even though computers
                    were very limited, a lot of interesting work was being
                    developed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1982, I went to study a master’s degree at the Royal
                    College of Art (RCA), in London, and I had the opportunity
                    to connect with a wider group of people.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>PA:</strong> You also took contemporary dance
                    classes while you were a student at the Ruskin School of
                    Art.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>WL:</strong> Yes, that was a big event. Arlette
                    Bonne, who was over from the USA, was running a workshop at
                    the Museum of Modern Art Oxford [now Modern Art Oxford]. She
                    got us walking, tracing out choreographic paths, in
                    particular moving in geometric patterns. As the group walked
                    along these paths, you would see patterns that emerged.
                    After that, I took those ideas into drawings, which
                    reflected these choreographic paths in 2D and then I pulled
                    them up into 3D. In this way, they became three dimensional
                    objects that were rule-based but inspired by choreography.
                    Until that point, I’d been doing paintings in the style of
                    Francis Bacon. I threw all that away, and then became much
                    more interested in Russian Constructivism and rule-based
                    art. Kenneth Martin taught me there; he was applying dice
                    throwing to generate a drawing system. I had an immediate
                    affinity with the beautiful drawings he produced.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> Some of those ideas can be seen in your
                    work <em>Spiral Balsa Wood Structure</em> (1982), which is
                    part of the V&amp;A collection.

                  <p>
                    <strong>WL</strong>: That work links directly back to that
                    dance class. It is a record of the dance patterns in 3D.
                    That was a key moment of change for my work, and I stuck
                    with that track until I got to the RCA. Then I met a new set
                    of lecturers: artists like Patrick Heron, John Hoyland and
                    Alistair Grant. They were quite challenging, and they pushed
                    me to do something novel again.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> During your time at the RCA, was the
                    work of your peers influential or were people there
                    dedicated to other types of art? And were there connections
                    between the school and industry at that time?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>WL:</strong> I was quite isolated at that time
                    because my colleagues were doing paintings in the style of
                    Julian Schnabel, and I was doing these obsessive patterned
                    drawings using rule-based systems. I found little in common
                    there with my fellow students, but I was lucky to be working
                    with the artist Keith Critchlow. And the artist Eduardo
                    Paolozzi was a big influence on me there. He was one of my
                    main mentors. I still think about some of the advice he gave
                    me. The RCA had a Computing Department; the artist Brian
                    Reffin Smith and architect John Lansdown were attached to
                    it. That department was ahead of its time. During that time,
                    I often visited the Natural History Museum, in London, and
                    spent time at the V&amp;A looking at Tantric art and mandala
                    imagery.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    From about 1985 to ‘87, I was doing a PhD with John Lansdown
                    and Keith Critchlow, working with a very good programmer
                    called Mike King, who helped me translate my ideas into
                    software. Around that time, Lansdown hosted meetings at the
                    Computer Arts Society (CAS) in Covent Garden. They were
                    great events, and I became part of that community. The
                    artist Paul Brown was heavily involved with CAS. He gave me
                    a part-time teaching job at Middlesex Polytechnic [now
                    Middlesex University]. At that point, the computer graphics
                    scene in London was beginning to take off. Lansdown had done
                    the 1979 <em>Alien</em> film intro. Other key figures of the
                    community were the artists Chris Briscoe and John Vince, who
                    wrote a software package called PICASSO that many production
                    houses were using for special effects. And there was the
                    interaction designer Gillian Crampton Smith who was at the
                    RCA. It was a very small and thriving community of people in
                    London involved with computer software and graphics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1987, I got an invitation from IBM that I followed up
                    with a call. By chance, I got the nuclear physicist Peter
                    Quarendon on the phone and he invited me to IBM in
                    Winchester to show my drawings to Stephen Todd and five
                    other engineers. I went there with my 10-foot drawings and
                    explained the rules that I was applying. Three months later,
                    they invited me to be an artist in residence with the
                    programming team using new software coded in the Energy
                    System Modelling Environment (ESME) and ray tracing. In a
                    Renaissance fashion, IBM created a scientific centre where
                    people from different disciplines worked together. I was at
                    IBM Winchester for six years and during that time I lost
                    contact with the London art scene. But I started to work
                    more internationally. I went abroad to the conferences
                    organized by the Special Interest Group on Computer Graphics
                    and Interactive Techniques (SIGGRAPH) and IMAGINA in Monte
                    Carlo, which was an annual festival and big hub of computer
                    graphics in that region. I had the solo exhibition ‘Empire
                    of Form’ in 1990 at the O Art Museum, in Tokyo, where I
                    spent time with the artist Yoichiro Kawaguchi. At that time,
                    there were no PCs around, so artists had to operate in the
                    corporate space to gain access to big machines. Companies

                    <strong>PA:</strong> Since early on in your career, you have
                    taken part in different events and exhibitions such as the
                    ‘State-of-the-art in Computer Animation’ conference (1986)
                    organized by BCS Computer Graphics &amp; Display Group and
                    CAS, at The Royal College of Art, and ‘The Conquest of Form’
                    exhibition at Arnolfini gallery, in Bristol (1988–9).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Could you tell us about the events that were both memorable
                    and important in establishing the digital art scene that
                    your practice originates from, or that further raised the
                    profile of your community of practice?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>WL:</strong> SIGGRAPH was a big influence. Film
                    companies premiered feature films at the conferences. People
                    like Jinn Blinn, Alan Nolte Milton, Manuel Brock, Ken Perlin
                    and Yoichiro Kawaguchi were presenting papers there. And it
                    had an art show running in parallel to the conference. With
                    IBM backing me, I was able to attend every year. In 1989, I
                    showed my 35mm film
                    <em>A Sequence from the Evolution of Form</em>. These events
                    helped me to gain international recognition and to connect
                    with incredible innovators whose technology is still used
                    today.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The catch was that as soon as you got involved with
                    technology and corporations, the art world did not like it.
                    My work was increasing in popularity during the early 1990s
                    and being shown in the scientific domain, at the Natural
                    History Museum, in London, and the Deutsches Museum, in
                    Munich. At that time, there was a lot of enmity between the
                    art world and the computer graphics scene. Not like now –
                    they really did not like computer art at all.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> Around the period these events took
                    place, what specific vocabulary was being used to describe
                    digital art?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>WL:</strong> There was no specific terminology and
                    that was always a problem. It was always a bit casual.
                    People called it either ‘computer art’ or sometimes
                    ‘computer graphics’. And definitely using the word
                    ‘graphics’ wasn’t good, as it implied a lower rung in the
                    hierarchy. On top of that, the audience was questioning
                    whether the creativity was coming from the artist or the
                    software. There was a lot of friction between practitioners
                    working with technology and the art world, and it has taken
                    almost 30 years for that reconciliation to happen. It’s only
                    now that most of the population in the UK are using PCs or
                    technology that the audience has become more sympathetic to
                    the challenges embedded to technological tools and its
                    associated themes.

                  <p>
                    <strong>PA:</strong> Over the years, you have collaborated
                    with different individuals across the UK and
                    internationally, including John Lansdown, Paul Brown,
                    Stephen Todd, Mark Ayres, Frederic Fol Leymarie and Mike
                    Sternberg. Could you tell us about these collaborations and
                    the expertise they have brought to your practice?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>WL:</strong> Over the years, I have collaborated
                    closely with Stephen Todd, and later with Professor Frederic
                    Fol Leymarie from Goldsmiths’ College [now Goldsmiths,
                    University of London]. There are some collaborations where I
                    am working with individuals every single day, especially for
                    software-based projects. For example, when I work with
                    Stephen Todd, he writes a piece of software, I try it out
                    and make many comments. He will then review these notes and
                    implement changes. We work within a very tight feedback
                    loop. In fact, with programmers and mathematicians, the
                    quicker you can provide feedback, the better because they
                    often work very quickly and thrive on that speed. Many of my
                    collaborations are framed by software development methods
                    where you are working together to engineer the software. My
                    role includes setting deadlines based on the opening of
                    exhibitions and projects.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mike Sternberg is the director of the Centre for Integrative
                    Systems Biology and Bioinformatics at Imperial College
                    London, with interest in the field of cancer and protein
                    docking. He had one of my works at his home and Frederic
                    introduced us. During that conversation he mentioned the way
                    my forms are structured has some similarities with the
                    beta-sheet structure in protein molecules and he suggested
                    applying the technology I was using in their scientific
                    problems. After that, Stephen Todd and his son Peter got
                    involved in the project. They are both incredible
                    programmers and they found a way to adapt our software to
                    Stenberg’s scientific research. The challenge with these
                    types of collaborations is that they are labelled as science
                    and never art. But when you, as an artist, work with
                    science, the ideas get pulled back into your art. You can
                    see this particularly with the virus work we did with
                    Professor Reidun Twarock at the University of York where we
                    learnt so much about capsid shells but ultimately found
                    ourselves viewing them in aesthetic terms. In a way, it is
                    similar to the process of drawing from nature to create a
                    painting, although we are looking at nature on a molecular
                    level. Ultimately, the art that is produced is abstract but
                    it is informed by molecular perspective.

                  <p>
                    Additionally, throughout my career, there have been key
                    support figures like Professor Robert Zimmer, who was Head
                    of Computing at Goldsmiths for eight years. He was very
                    caring and created a good environment that enabled the
                    formation of a strong community in the university. The
                    scientist Margaret A. Boden is a big champion of artificial
                    intelligence and she encouraged me and backed my work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another significant figure was the Surrealist painter
                    Roberto Matta who bought some of my work. I visited his
                    studio in Paris, and we were together in a panel
                    conversation for the IMAGINA festival about computers and
                    Surrealist art in 1990. Matta was trained as an architect,
                    so structure and form are core elements of his work. He also
                    applied chance to his painting practice which was a popular
                    theme within Surrealist ideologies. They used the dice to
                    generate random numbers and I applied – and still apply –
                    random number generators to create <em>Mutator</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Paolozzi, who I mentioned earlier, had a significant impact
                    on me when he was my professor at the RCA. I wasn’t working
                    with him on a daily basis, but he was always challenging me.
                    He would often advise me to leave art school and work in the
                    computer software environment to make a living. I learned
                    from Paolozzi that you should pursue what interests you and
                    not care about whatever everyone else thinks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>PA:</strong> Are there other individuals based in
                    the UK who have influenced or supported your practice, or
                    who you consider have made key contributions to the UK
                    digital art ecosystem?

                  <p>
                    <strong>WL:</strong> Jasia Reichardt obviously, who curated
                    the first computer art exhibition in the UK, ‘Cybernetic
                    Serendipity’, at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA),
                    London, back in 1968 (and celebrated in a retrospective a
                    few months ago). I got to know her and her work many years
                    later after her audacious debut, but she remained and
                    remains a powerful force within this area and has always
                    been supportive of my work. Although not in the UK, the
                    Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.) group in New
                    York, also from the late ’60s, was very influential. Barry
                    Barker, who was the director of the Arnolfini, and Stephen
                    Snoddy, who was a curator there, were big advocates for my
                    work. The support from the V&amp;A has been really good over
                    the years. And the Henry Moore Institute, in Leeds, backed
                    my work too; I was a Henry Moore scholar at the RCA. In
                    fact, I knew Henry Moore quite well. The team at Gazelli Art
                    House and Valentina Ravaglia, Curator of Displays and
                    International Art at Tate Modern, both in London, have
                    provided incredible support during the last year.

                    Outside of the UK, I should also mention Frédéric Migayrou,
                    Deputy Director of the Centre Pompidou, in Paris, and Anna
                    Frants, Director of CYFEST: International Media Art
                    Festival, which is hosted in a different city every year.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> Throughout your career, you have been
                    part of groups and social formations that have existed
                    within and beyond the UK, contributing to the development of
                    the digital arts. For example, CAS and the computing
                    community at Goldsmiths. Could you expand on these and other
                    digital art communities in the UK and globally that you
                    belong to, which have been influential to the development of

                    <strong>WL:</strong> Cyber was a key counter-culture
                    movement. When I finished at IBM, my audience was not
                    mainstream, it was formed by people who were going to raves,
                    dancing to music and watching my work. All my videos had
                    been bootlegged and were projected in huge garages and
                    factories. This is why I went from IBM to the entertainment
                    industry where I worked with different record labels and
                    music bands, like the famous Scottish psychedelic band The
                    Shamen. After that, Warner Brothers approached me to do art
                    inspired by organic life. Then I drifted into the video game
                    industry for almost 10 years and ended up directing a big
                    studio of around 70 people where we created games that at
                    the time were visually quite cutting-edge.

                    During the 1990s, people who were doing interesting work
                    tended to either become academics or go into cyber culture.
                    This cultural moment was characterized by a celebratory
                    attitude towards technology with figures like Bruce Sterling
                    and William Gibson working on the genre of cyberpunk. It was
                    quite similar to the moment we are living now with
                    artificial intelligence being in the public eye. Culturally,
                    the 1990s was a very exciting period with a lot of
                    excitement around the internet, rave music and sampling.

                  <p>
                    In 2004, Mick Grierson, Janis Jefferies and Frederic Fol
                    Leymarie formed the Digital Arts Computing course at
                    Goldsmiths (Grierson would later go on to set up the
                    Creative Computing Institute at University of the Arts
                    London). I was invited around that time to help build that
                    group. Goldsmiths became a centre for computer art and
                    computational creativity with a strong critical mass
                    composed of the teaching staff and PhD students. Goldsmiths
                    had a push on virtual and augmented reality, alongside
                    medical work. It continues to operate today as a strong
                    cluster for innovation.

                    Regarding these digital communities, Middlesex Polytechnic
                    was a hub for computer art in the 1990s. John Lansdown and
                    Paul Brown were involved, and I worked there in the early
                    days. The Polytechnic had equipment and hardware like the
                    Quantel Paintbox. Leicester Polytechnic [now De Montfort
                    University] was another cluster with Ernest Edmonds and Sean
                    Clark. Both Brown and Edmonds were influenced by the Systems
                    art group which was formed in London during the 1970s.
                    Another interesting cluster was the National Centre for
                    Computer Animation at Bournemouth University with Peter
                    Comninos and John Vince where they were doing work with film
                    and computer graphics. Gareth Edwards, who studied at the
                    RCA with me, became part of that group.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> As a practitioner with expertise in the
                    field of artificial evolutionary systems, could you outline
                    some of the key technologies and tools that have made your
                    practice possible?

                  <p>
                    <strong>WL:</strong> I have had the luxury of having access
                    to custom software, which is really important because it
                    gives the work a different look. Some artists are using
                    Unreal or Photoshop and you can spot the aesthetics; it is
                    the same with programs like Midjourney or DALL-E. That is
                    the reason why I have always pushed on using customized
                    technology. In the early days, I did work for the BBC using
                    BBC BASIC and BBC microcomputers. I used Fortran 77 for the
                    work I developed when studying at Oxford.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When I was at IBM, we were using proprietary software, and a
                    language called Extensible Solid Modelling Editor (ESME).
                    There was also WINSOM, a Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG)
                    modelling package which allowed you to do Boolean operators
                    where you could take a sphere and subtract a cube from it in
                    a precise way similar to carving. The forms are very defined
                    because you utilize spatial subdivisions instead of
                    polygons, and the cuts are applied to individual pixels.
                    Chris Briscoe and John Vince’s PICASSO interactive graphics
                    modelling program was very good for handcrafting during the
                    1980s.

                  <p>
                    Historically, I have tended to only use the software I have
                    developed with my collaborators. At the moment, I am using
                    tools like Geiger pixels where you can take an image and
                    increase its resolution. Virtual reality (VR) is very
                    important for my work. We mainly use HTC Vive PCs which run
                    the experience in real time at 90 frames per second. VR is a
                    new tool and art form where, if the work operates
                    successfully, you can conceptually shift the audience’s
                    spatial reality. In VR, the audience ceases to be merely an
                    observer and becomes part of the artwork, which is very
                    powerful from an engagement point of view.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> We have discussed some of the
                    references of your work such as Surrealism, Tantric art and
                    nature. It would also be interesting to hear more about the
                    thinkers and theoretical concepts that have helped shape
                    your work.

                    <strong>WL:</strong> Conceptually, once the software has
                    been built, the computer becomes a creative partner. In this
                    scenario, there is an evolutionary interface between the
                    artist and the software. Once you fine-tune the software, it
                    can be quite addictive to play with the systems, because you
                    never know what these will give back to you. I find this
                    part of the work very enjoyable and that is what makes me
                    ready to spend hours developing the theory that will deliver
                    that experience. My motivation is the fascination with the
                    potential and limitations of human creativity and the
                    generative power of the machine. Theoretically, my work goes
                    back to classical Greek thinking about solid geometry,
                    perspective, mathematics, and the celebration of mathematics
                    and arts. The work can be a bit contentious, as it contains
                    Freudian elements and deliberately tries to play with
                    people’s fears, showcasing bugs and worms at a microscopic
                    perspective, though as well as being uncanny, it’s often
                    quite humorous. The biologist and mathematician D’Arcy
                    Thompson is a big influence on me, as is Leonardo da Vinci’s
                    idea of illusionary depth and use of perspective.

                    John Lifton (b. 1944, United Kingdom) is an artist and
                    theorist whose work explores the relationships between art,
                    science, the environment and technology. In 1968, he
                    co-founded the Institute for Research in Art and Technology
                    in London (IRAT, also known as the New Arts Lab), a pivotal
                    space for the avant-garde art scene that enabled
                    experimentation in film, video, sculpture and literature.

                    <strong>Pita Arreola:</strong> Reflecting on the beginning
                    of your career, could you elaborate on your earliest
                    encounters with computer art and how you came to incorporate
                    certain methodologies and technologies into your practice?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>John Lifton:</strong> Growing up, I had a particular
                    disposition towards analogue and mechanical tools, but to
                    properly answer your question I have to go back to my
                    mother’s influence. She was born in Argentina, of British
                    parents. My grandfather had migrated with his family from
                    Devonshire as a teenager. He was a very bright guy and got a
                    job on the building of a railroad system from scratch with a
                    contract underwritten by the British and Argentine
                    governments. He ended up doing surveys to determine where
                    the lines would go and contributing towards the design of
                    the stations, depots, even writing the timetables. I think
                    my mother wanted me to be like him. I saw him as a
                    Renaissance man of the First Machine Age.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Second World War was just over when I was little, so my
                    mother wanted me to have a great education for the post-war
                    world. As an amateur painter, she started taking me to
                    museums and galleries in London when I was 18 months old,
                    and I loved it. We lived in Northwood on the Metropolitan
                    Line, and we could get into the city centre in little over
                    half an hour. We would spend the whole day looking at
                    museums and have lunch at Lyons’ Corner House. My favourite
                    outing was the British Museum and especially the Egyptian
                    collection from which I developed a lifelong love of
                    Egyptology. So, my interest in art, tools and machinery was
                    deeply embedded in me by about the age of five and continued
                    all my life. I was also incredibly interested in seeing
                    buildings under construction, and I’m told I announced at
                    five that I would be an architect when I grew up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Later, I went to the Merchant Taylors’ School which was at
                    Moor Park, nearby. I was the only student who had a special
                    dispensation to trade out some of the science time to work
                    in the art studio. Even then, I insisted on doing both art
                    and science. I don’t know when I first came across computer
                    art; it hardly existed as a category back then. Most people,
                    if you mentioned computer art, would give you a totally
                    blank look as it didn’t mean anything. At that time, I was
                    thinking of an artist’s studio as a place extended to
                    include design and the construction of electronics and
                    computing equipment. The other people that I knew with a
                    similar perspective were musicians, because electronics had
                    penetrated music more than other areas of the arts.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> Since early in your career, you have
                    taken part in different events and exhibitions such as
                    ‘Cybernetic Serendipity’ (1968) at the Institute of
                    Contemporary Arts (ICA); and ’Event One’ (1969) at Royal
                    College of Art (RCA), both in London; ‘INTERACT. Machine:
                    Man: Society’ (1973), organized by the Computer Arts Society
                    (CAS) for the Edinburgh International Festival; and ‘Green
                    Music’ (1975) at Whitechapel Gallery, in London. Could you
                    tell us about these and other events that were both
                    memorable and important in establishing the digital art
                    scene or circle that your practice originates from? And
                    which helped raise the profile of that community?

                  <p>
                    <strong>JL:</strong> At that time there were very few people
                    working in this area and they were all over Britain. Some
                    were concentrated in London, but it still was a tiny group.
                    Most people that I knew who were involved in computer art
                    were always struggling to get an hour or two on a computer.
                    When I look back at the people that my wife Pamela Zoline
                    and I knew back then, they were artists such as Joe Tilson,
                    Ron Kitaj and Richard Hamilton. Their work did not focus on
                    computer art, but they were interested in the broader
                    spectrum of what was going on in the arts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I was heavily involved in the founding of the New Arts Lab
                    at Robert Street, in London, in 1968, and got to know the
                    composer Hugh Davies who oversaw music there. We were close
                    friends and in 1970 we started a music performance group
                    called Naked Software with the composer Annea Lockwood and
                    producer Harvey Matusow. We toured around the country with
                    two hundred instruments that we used for our improvisations
                    during the performances.

                    place, what specific vocabulary was being used to describe
                    digital art? It would be good to hear about them given how
                    terminologies have been used and changed across different
                    periods.

                    <strong>JL:</strong> The term ‘cybernetics’ was very
                    commonly used back then. I think I learned about it from the
                    cybernetician George Mallen who had got it from the
                    cybernetician Gordon Pask. The second term is ‘symbiotic
                    art’ which I proposed myself in discussions I had with the
                    writer and systems engineer Jonathan Benthall in 1969. I
                    thought the term provided a good description of the work I
                    was doing which was aiming to generate real-time behavioural
                    interaction between people and artworks. Jonathan made that
                    term public in an article he published in the art magazine
                    <em>Studio International</em> in June 1969. I still see it
                    used occasionally, but with a different intent. Generally,
                    ‘computer art’ was a huge general term which swallowed
                    everything.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> Over the years, you have collaborated
                    with different individuals across the UK and abroad
                    including Richard Lowenberg, John Lansdown, David Curtis and
                    Carolee Schneemann. Could you tell us about these
                    collaborations and the expertise they have brought to your
                    practice?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>JL:</strong> There were two quite different art
                    movements that I was lucky to be deeply involved with in the
                    mid-to-late ‘60s. And neither of them were style movements.
                    The first was the Computer Arts Society (CAS). At the time
                    it was formed, its goal was to promote the creative use of
                    computers in the arts and to encourage the interchange of
                    information in this area. As I can remember, it was my
                    friend, the artist Gustav Metzger, who told me that CAS had
                    been formed the previous week and gave me John Lansdown’s
                    contact information. I went to John’s office the next day
                    and signed up, becoming among the eight early members. That
                    was the start of a period when I worked closely with CAS and
                    often provided labour to help with their activities. For
                    several years, the society ran regular meetings and there
                    would be additional meetings when someone of interest was in
                    town. These meetings were held at John’s architectural
                    office in Bloomsbury during the early years.

                  <p>
                    The other art movement that I was involved with was the Arts
                    Labs. Jim Haynes, who created it, was an American who had
                    moved to Edinburgh in the late 1950s and founded Britain’s
                    first paperback bookshop, which he ran like his personal
                    salon in the manner of an eighteenth-century coffee house
                    where people gathered for a conversation or commerce. People
                    met and talked all day, every day, and he was there talking
                    to them. He was very skillful at this, and he had a huge
                    effect on things. The Paperback Bookshop staged plays on a
                    small scale and that led Jim to found the Traverse Theatre
                    in Edinburgh during 1962. He moved to London in 1964 and
                    opened the first Arts Lab in Drury Lane, which was an
                    enlarged version of the salon, but it immediately became a
                    centre of the London art scene for my generation.

                    different groups of people together?

                  <p>
                    <strong>JL:</strong> I think there was a mood of change and
                    a sense of leaving the war behind us. We were a new
                    generation that did not have any experience of the war and
                    wanted to do new things. We wanted the art world to be less
                    strictly divided than it had been in the past. We were
                    breaking barriers and mixing things up in order to try new
                    stuff and that was a very dominant feeling for my
                    generation.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> Are there other individuals who were
                    based in the UK that have influenced or supported your
                    practice, or whom you consider to have made key
                    contributions to the UK digital art ecosystem?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>JL:</strong> My first full-time job as an architect
                    was working for Hackney Borough Council after graduating
                    from the Bartlett School of Architecture, at University
                    College London in 1966. The council assigned me a 810,000
                    square metre area of mid-Victorian housing called De
                    Beauvoir Town to do a redevelopment study as part of their
                    long-term planning. I think it was during the spring of 1967
                    when I was walking around the area with a colleague, and he
                    mentioned I needed to meet someone. He took me into a
                    rundown garage and introduced me to the cybernetic sculptor
                    Edward Ihnatowicz working on his piece
                    <em>Sound Activated Mobile</em> (SAM) which Ihnatowicz later
                    showed at the ‘Cybernetic Serendipity’ exhibition at the ICA
                    in 1968. We instantly became friends and I found many
                    excuses to drop by and see him during my work day. He was a
                    great inspiration to me because of his dedication and
                    single-mindedness. I have no idea how he made a living
                    because he seemed to be working full-time on his sculptural
                    work. Seeing him made me consider for the first time whether
                    I could stop working in architectural offices and become a
                    professional computer artist.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Shortly after this, a rebellion at the Drury Lane Arts Lab
                    happened. I was part of the breakaway group that in 1969
                    created the New Arts Lab, at Robert Street. This group
                    included the author Pamela Zoline, the artist David Curtis
                    and his wife, the artist Biddy Peppin. Pamela and I just
                    celebrated our fiftieth anniversary and that was the start
                    of many very happy years. They had all been close friends of
                    mine since I was at Bartlett because they were studying just
                    next door at the Slade School of Fine Art.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I did take the opening of the New Arts Lab as the
                    opportunity to stop working in architecture and to set up a
                    cybernetics workshop. I kind of moved to the lab and started
                    working on stuff without any income. It was a big risk, but
                    London was cheap then, and I got odd bits of jobs that
                    helped me stay afloat. When we were setting up the Arts Lab,
                    I persuaded the group to incorporate it as the Institute for
                    Research in Art and Technology (IRAT), because I saw an
                    opportunity to bridge the more hippie-orientated Arts Lab
                    scene with the academic world. The institute only lasted a
                    couple of years, but it did influence the London arts scene.

                    part of groups and social formations that have existed
                    within and beyond the UK, and have contributed to the

                    Could you expand on these and other digital art communities

                    <strong>JL:</strong> The Robert Street New Arts Lab moved on
                    to be what was called The Dairy, in Chalk Farm. This space
                    was less public, it operated more like private studios,
                    although there were some public activities going on. That
                    building, like the Robert Street one, had been leased from
                    Camden Council on a nominal rent because the council bought
                    those spaces to demolish them and build public housing.
                    There were these short periods of two to three years before
                    these buildings would get torn down where we could improve
                    them and make use of them. Pamela and I felt that we needed
                    something more settled after Drury Lane, Robert Street and
                    the Dairy, so we bought a house in Dorset and started having
                    children. I started teaching in 1974 at the RCA, in London,
                    in the Department of Environmental Media and carried out
                    research in the Design Research Department there too. Around
                    that time, I wanted to expand my practice by doing more
                    serious research and I obtained a grant from the UK’s
                    Science Research Council to develop a project on computer
                    simulation of cognition in architectural design.

                    In 1977, Pam’s parents started building a ski area in
                    Telluride, Colorado, and asked us to go there for a year to
                    help with the business. At the end of the year, they sold
                    the controlling interest to developers. We thought then that
                    we would go back to Dorset, but the developers asked me to
                    design a new resort town for a population of 8,000. It was
                    an incredible opportunity, from a design point of view, and
                    we decided to stay longer. For a variety of reasons, we just
                    ended up living in Colorado and we are still here. My life
                    changed completely at this point, because I stopped being
                    heavily involved in digital art. But some of those ideas had
                    continuity in other projects. Prior to Colorado, in London,
                    I had met the artist Richard Lowenberg as we both were part
                    of <em>The Secret Life of Plants</em> (released 1979) movie,
                    for which I had taken my piece
                    <em>Green Music (1973, and later versions)</em>, which made
                    live music from the electrical activity within plants,* to
                    Los Angeles and San Francisco to film it in operation.
                    Richard had done other interactive work with dancers and
                    other collaborators. We became very close friends. In 1979,
                    Pam and I worked with Richard on an event called ‘Arts and
                    Sciences’, which brought together artists and scientists to
                    Telluride. It was so successful that in 1984 it led us to
                    co-founding the non-profit Telluride Institute that operates
                    across the spectrum of arts, humanities and sciences.
                    Richard worked with us for many years, before moving to
                    Santa Fe. This year (2024) we have celebrated the fortieth
                    anniversary of the Telluride Institute, and Richard, at the
                    same time, put on a reprise of Arts and Sciences. His
                    eight-day event was distributed on the internet by The
                    Leonardo Art Science Evening Rendezvous (LASER).

                    <strong>PA:</strong> As a practitioner with expertise in the
                    field of electronic systems and their relationship with
                    natural processes, could you outline some of the key
                    technologies and tools that have made your practice

                    <strong>JL:</strong> It is hard to describe how primitive
                    the field was back then. The reason I first got involved
                    with technology was that I had a great love of music. Around
                    the age of 10, I started building amplifiers, loudspeakers
                    and other pieces of valve (tube) audio equipment. I used to
                    get the parts from electronic component stores in London. I
                    remember buying my first transistors a bit later. There were
                    only three types of transistors that you could buy: red,
                    green and white. They were all made on the same production
                    line, and someone would manually test each one of them for
                    gain and put on a colour paint spot.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When I got interested in the creative use of computing, and
                    not having any access to computers, I started building the
                    circuits I needed, which were initially analogue. In the
                    mid-1960s, the first integrated circuits (ICs) appeared.
                    Back then, I remember going around the headquarters of the
                    manufacturers in London and begging for gifts of integrated
                    circuits for artistic use. Most of the time they were
                    surprised and charmed that somebody would want to use their
                    products for art, which made them generous. These early
                    microchips had few logic gates or operations and typically
                    contained 20 to 30 transistors within each chip. I could
                    manage to design what I needed using them because it was
                    very simple.

                    Transistors and integrated circuits were key technologies in
                    my early work, and they appeared just at the right time.
                    Most of the people that I knew who were interested in
                    computer arts back then managed to get occasional access to
                    computer terminals that had online connections to digital
                    computers which were running at 110 bits per second. The
                    speed of this online connection seems useless now, but it
                    was amazing and wonderful at that time. The Teletype ASR-33
                    terminals were a great hit, preceding personal computers.

                  <p>
                    Later, when I set up the cybernetic workshop at the New Arts
                    Lab in 1968, we installed an ASR-33 terminal. If it was for
                    artistic purposes only, anybody could come and use it for
                    free and it got quite a lot of use. I was told later that
                    this was probably the first free computer terminal in the
                    world dedicated solely to the arts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>PA:</strong> Could you tell us how you managed
                    supporting other artists to use this technology?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>JL:</strong> I did not personally get involved in
                    that, but these types of terminals were run using BASIC as a
                    programming language. CAS put on training programmes to
                    teach people how to use them, and there were many artists
                    that got involved and put a lot of time into learning how to
                    program and ended up producing very serious work. Colin
                    Emmett, in particular, made heavy use of this terminal,
                    sometimes working on it all through the night.

                  <p>
                    The speed things were happening was remarkable. Only six
                    years later, the RCA was the only arts institution in the
                    world on the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network
                    (ARPANET), the forerunner of the internet, run by the USA
                    military. When I worked there, the artist Harold Cohen
                    visited the Design Research Department and produced a
                    drawing which was programmed in San Diego and printed in
                    London. We regarded this as the first true international
                    work of computer art, because it was produced in real time
                    across two continents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Harold had been Pamela’s teacher at the Slade. He moved to
                    the USA in 1968 and worked as a lecturer at the University
                    of California in San Diego. He ended up working there for 30
                    years and we would occasionally visit him. By the early
                    1970s, he had produced an early version of his computer
                    program AARON, which generated paintings and drawings. I
                    consider Harold’s work to be at that time the most
                    sophisticated computer art that was being made anywhere. He
                    was a first rate painter himself plus he really liked
                    programming, which was an ideal combination.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> Finally, it would be interesting to
                    hear about the thinkers and theoretical concepts that have
                    helped shape your work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>JL:</strong> When I think back to that time, there
                    was not a lot of theorizing going on. People were excited
                    about getting their hands on computers and doing stuff. But
                    there were two professors at Bartlett that really helped
                    shape my thinking. The first one was the extraordinary
                    engineer Richard Buckminster Fuller. He only came for a few
                    days each year, but I found him incredibly interesting. He
                    saw nature as the epitome of energy and material efficiency.
                    He wanted engineering to imitate that, not formally, but he
                    thought great design should produce the maximum
                    performance-per-kilogram weight of the materials that you
                    are using. And, geodesic domes, which he invented, for him
                    were moving that concern as an engineer into architecture. I
                    couldn’t have disagreed more with him, but this was very
                    important at the same time. I still have a tiny bucket in a
                    corner of my mind that uses this test on things. I’ll give
                    you an example of why I don’t agree with Buckminster. I have
                    a great admiration for Scandinavian sod roofs, which go back
                    at least 1,500 years. These start with a layer of bark put
                    down as a waterproofing layer. Then they dig up lots of
                    sods, usually 15 to 20 centimetres deep. And they pack them
                    on top to recreate the natural surface of the ground. And
                    this is almost the antithesis of Buckminster’s goal. This
                    roof is incredibly heavy, and it requires a massive wooden
                    structure underneath to support that weight. From an
                    engineering point of view it has a very low
                    performance-per-kilogram weight. Why would one want to build
                    a roof like that now? Well, first, the sod roof materials
                    are cheap because they don’t need to be shaped much. Second,
                    the materials come from the site, so they do not need to be
                    transported. Third, the local ecosystem is preserved, and
                    the roof will last for hundreds of years with very little
                    maintenance. And finally, it’s beautiful and it’s a profound
                    aesthetic statement about living gently on the land. My
                    generation’s view of nature was totally different from his,
                    which dated back to the 1930s.
                  </p>

                    The second influential person is the architect Peter Reyner
                    Banham, mostly known as Reyner Banham. He made his
                    reputation by writing the first detailed description of the
                    Modern Movement which treated it with the same historical
                    seriousness as other major architectural movements. Banham
                    was our on-staff history teacher at Bartlett. During my
                    first year there, the Modern Movement was the only history
                    that was taught, which was totally revolutionary at the time
                    for a school of architecture. He later became my thesis
                    supervisor and a very good friend. He was an advisory board
                    member on the New Arts Lab. I think the important thing I
                    learned from him was to have very high standards of accuracy
                    and strictness in conducting research. This improved the
                    quality of everything that I did, including artworks and
                    anything that required study.

                    Stephen Willats (b. 1943, United Kingdom) is a
                    multidisciplinary artist who combines in his work
                    cybernetics, advertising research, learning and
                    communications theory, and computer technology. Since the
                    early 1960s, Willats has located his work in individual and
                    social behaviours and through collaborative and
                    participatory artworks has sought to generate societal
                    change.

                    <strong>Pita Arreola:</strong> Reflecting on the beginning
                    of your career, could you elaborate on your earliest
                    encounters with computer art and how you came to incorporate
                    certain methodologies and technologies into your practice?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Stephen Willats:</strong> Foremost, I never thought
                    of my [creative] life as a career. I always saw myself as an
                    artist pursuing ideas. The idea that there would be
                    structure in terms of a career never occurred to me. Now, to
                    answer your question, we have to go back to 1958 when the
                    world I was living in was changing remarkably quickly from
                    the world that my parents lived in. Suddenly, there was a
                    whole generation rebelling against the restrictions and
                    conventions of earlier generations. All the barriers began
                    to break down. People started to feel mobile and to think
                    that a new vision of a world could be transformed into
                    reality. These changes led to avant-garde ideas becoming
                    prevalent at that time in the art world across Europe and
                    the UK. From the point of view of the artist, we had the
                    idea that a work of art needed to move forward and push
                    things further.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Remarkably, in 1958, I found myself working at Drian
                    Galleries, in London, as a gallery assistant at a very young
                    age and meeting significant artists from the UK, like Henry
                    Moore and Francis Bacon, and from Europe and Latin America,
                    such as Yaacov Agam, Lucio Fontana, Gyula Kosice and the
                    Zero Group. The gallery was connected to Europe, which was
                    very unusual at that time. Most of the galleries back then
                    were linked to St Ives and the British tradition. During
                    that time, I helped to organize and present many exhibitions
                    including the solo and group shows of Stephen Gilbert, Piero
                    Manzoni, the Group Zero and the British Constructivist
                    artists, as well as Eastern European artists. Kosice and
                    Agam were particularly important to me. Kosice was a
                    socialist and had the idea that the audience should engage
                    with the variables that the work was constructed from and
                    find personal meaning in their experience by reorganizing
                    the work’s configurations, so the work became interactive
                    and the audience an active participant, instead of operating
                    as a receiver of the message as you would do with radio.
                    This concept was quite significant for me.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not many people came to the gallery, so I had plenty of free
                    time. My father was an archivist and he managed to get books
                    from the library that he passed to me. I read books by the
                    philosophers Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Marshall McLuhan and the
                    sociologist Basil Bernstein. Through them, I began to
                    realize that the construction of the world was ideological
                    and that the world I lived in could be different, and people
                    could behave and socialize differently. I figured that
                    instead of having vertical social hierarchies, there could
                    be horizontal networks. When I was not reading, I drew
                    sketches on how the gallery could function as a space,
                    trying to improve the visitor experience. I thought we had
                    all these fabulous exhibitions happening and nobody was
                    coming. Through this analysis, it seemed to me that artworks
                    demand at least two factors, person A and person B. In other
                    words, there had to be a network of exchanges for the
                    exhibition to really operate and have some meaning in the
                    wider world.

                    Another book my father gave me was
                    <em>Mechanization of Thought Processes</em> (1958), based on
                    a symposium that was organized by the National Physical
                    Laboratory, in England, on the fundamentals of artificial
                    intelligence (AI) and neural systems, and cybernetics as a
                    philosophical and language modelling tool. Many significant
                    practitioners attended this symposium such as the
                    neurophysiologist and robotician William Grey Walter, the
                    computer scientist Marvin Minsky, the cybernetician Gordon
                    Pask and the scientist Heinz von Foerster.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After reading that publication, I began to think about how
                    neural systems could give us a model of society. Realizing
                    that I needed to connect to all these ideas, I set up a
                    think tank in 1961–2 with mathematicians, philosophers and
                    artists. Theories sprang up all over the place, such as
                    behavioural theory, game theory, lateral thinking theory,
                    learning theory, random variable theory, probability theory
                    and systems theory, just to name a few. Responding to these,
                    I made a series of works that were to be part of my first
                    exhibition at Gallery One, in central London, which was a
                    famous avant-garde gallery at that time. These works were
                    participatory and experienced in a sequence like a learning
                    program, starting with <em>Work No. 1</em> (1962) a very
                    simple set of variables and gradually increasing in
                    complexity to <em>Work No. 6</em> (1962). Using a response
                    sheet, participants could plot the changes they were making
                    or their relationship with the work. These sheets were then
                    exhibited next to the work and people could see that
                    outcomes were relative to the individual person.
                    Unfortunately, the gallery went bankrupt a month before my
                    show. (Eventually these works were displayed in 2014 at the
                    ‘Control. Stephen Willats. Work 1962–69’ exhibition curated
                    by Alex Sainsbury at Raven Row, in London)

                  <p>
                    Around that time, I realized that I needed new tools to
                    develop further my ideas and one of the consequences was
                    that I published a series of manifestos on topics related to
                    the new attitudes and vision of art practice including
                    Conceptualism and the omnidirectional nature of reality. I
                    used to distribute them at gallery openings and the
                    galleries did not like it. For this reason, I found myself
                    out on the street quite often. But the idea of the
                    manifestos was to disrupt things as they were and to create
                    a conceptual and intellectual territory in which my ideas
                    could be received. Then, the artist Dennis Bowen, who opened
                    the New Vision Centre Gallery, in London, told me about this
                    Groundcourse at Ealing School of Art run by the artist Roy
                    Ascott and suggested that I left my job at the gallery and
                    went there. The staff included the most relevant artists in
                    London at that time, Brian Wall, Bernard and Harold Cohen,
                    Anthony Benjamin and William Green, who was one of the first
                    Auto-destructivers, even before the artist Gustav Metzger.
                    It was a very radical group and an exciting place to go.
                    Ascott had been in Newcastle and that region was very
                    influenced by the artist László Moholy-Nagy and the
                    Institute of Design in Chicago. For this reason, the course
                    presented ideas of media dexterity. At that point, Ascott
                    also made the statement that ‘theory should precede
                    practice’ which changed culture.

                    One day, Gordon Pask came to give a lecture. Not many
                    students knew about his work, but I had read the paper he
                    presented at the ‘Mechanization of Thought Processes’*
                    symposium. His lecture introduced students to the idea of
                    cybernetics and discussed relevant principles like feedback
                    and the black box. I found the lecture very inspiring
                    because it presented another type of society where instead
                    of preserving information as power, there was a possibility
                    of distributing information within an interactive network of
                    mutuality. Bernard Cohen commented that Pask was trying to
                    turn people into machines to which Pask responded, ‘You have
                    infinite variables; you are not just machines’. His lecture
                    had a profound impact on the staff, and it provoked a
                    radical change in the work of that group of artists.

                  <p>
                    In my case, in 1963, I went to work at the System Research
                    Lab, in Richmond, where I met the cybernetician George
                    Mallen and the mathematician Peter Whittle. This opened
                    possibilities for creating a totally new language for
                    artists. In artistic movements like Cubism and Futurism,
                    artists were encoding reality through a language of objects.
                    Whereas cybernetics presented a language that described a
                    world based on the flow of information. I did not want to
                    make pictures of cybernetics, I wanted to use it as a
                    framework for engineering interactive simulation. Systems
                    Research was significant for this process. Whittle was one
                    of the early people using digital programs for electronic
                    engineering and we discussed how I could build something.
                    Then I met Chris Grimshaw, who was running a lab in Oxford,
                    and he took over these discussions. Around this time, I
                    developed a series of works based on the idea of cooperative
                    behaviour that led to the creation of my work
                    <em>Visual Homeostat</em> (1966–9).* This work is composed
                    of two units which were coupled through photoelectric cells
                    and an ultrasonic environment. The units were quite large,
                    around 1.83 metres high by 3.65 metres wide, and the work
                    was shown in a dark environment. As soon as the work
                    detected someone within its ultrasonic field, it turned
                    itself on and ran a program of lights which followed
                    sequences over a mesh. The speed of the lights was reactive
                    to the audience’s presence and they could also interfere
                    with the activity between the units by standing between them
                    and by doing so, triggering different programs. I made those
                    works for a project at Tate that never took place.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> Since early in your career, you have
                    taken part in different events and exhibitions such as
                    ‘Electric Theatre’, Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA),
                    London (1971);
                    <em>‘<em>INTERACT Machine: Man: Society’ (1973), organized by
                        the Computer Arts Society (CAS) for the Edinburgh
                        International Festival; and ‘Structures and Codes’</em>,</em>
                    Royal College of Art, London (1975). Could you tell us about
                    these and other events that were both memorable and
                    important in establishing the creative circle that your
                    practice originates from, or that further raised the profile
                    of your community of practice?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>SW:</strong> During the 1960s many people from the
                    underground cultural scene would come to my studio, as well
                    as scientists such as Christopher Evans, Basil Bernstein,
                    Edward de Bono and Desmond Morris, who were exploring
                    language codes on apes. De Bono’s work was very influential
                    for my work; he came up with the concept of ‘lateral
                    thinking’ which challenges linear thinking. At that time
                    people were trying to break down the barriers between
                    different disciplines, so you had conversations between
                    artists and scientists. The first exhibition that I had in
                    1964 was at a small gallery set up by doctors at the Chester
                    Beatty Research Institute, a public research institute
                    specialized in oncology situated in Fulham Road, London,
                    because they understood all the potential of these ideas
                    while the mainstream of the art world certainly did not.
                    Shortly after this, in a period of self-doubt about the
                    special role of the artist’s creativity, I stopped calling
                    myself an artist and became a conceptual designer for nine
                    months.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Around that time, in 1965, I started
                    <em>Control</em> magazine and made clothing like the example
                    that is part of the V&amp;A’s collection. The idea was to
                    create new ways to understand an artwork, for example, with
                    the piece of clothing you could wear it and it changed your
                    engagement with other people you might encounter and the
                    world you passed through while wearing it. Additionally, you
                    could buy it at a boutique instead of an art gallery. Though
                    London galleries like Indica and Signals were very
                    significant places at that time, they were not linked to
                    digital art as you define it nowadays. Signals was linked to
                    ideas of kineticism and was an important place for artists
                    to connect with each other. Indica emerged later.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I was part of this milieu. I met John Sharkey who was a
                    concrete poet and also worked at the ICA. There was also a
                    group of people who organized with Gustav Metzger the
                    ‘Destruction in Art Symposium’ (1966). I was part of that
                    team and helped to create the promotional materials. I also
                    wrote an essay for a presentation,
                    <em>The Mechanistic Crisis,</em> which looked at
                    decision-making and problem-solving within hierarchical
                    linear and self-organizing systems. The idea was that this
                    symposium would bring people together just like
                    ‘Mechanization of Thought Processes’ did for cybernetics at
                    a time where the art world was becoming increasingly
                    politicized with Marxism, determinism and anarchism. It was
                    a very interesting period, but also became frightening as
                    the 1960s progressed because people were becoming somewhat
                    paranoid.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> Around the period these events took
                    place, what specific vocabulary was being used to describe
                    digital art? It would be good to hear about that,
                    considering how terminologies have changed across different
                    periods.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>SW:</strong> That was a problem, because I have been
                    in many exhibitions with many different terminologies.
                    Including ‘Kunst Licht Kunst’ (1966) at the Stedelijk van
                    Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, which was a major exhibition of
                    light art, and ‘Kinetic four dimensional’ (‘K.4’) (1967)
                    which took place at Brighton Festival and involved the
                    designer Philip Steadman, who had placed particular emphasis
                    in the field of kinetic art and concrete poetry. As well as,
                    in London, the ICA’s ‘Electric Theatre’ (1971) and Hayward
                    Gallery’s ‘Kinetic Art’ (1970)<em>,</em> where I presented
                    <em>Visual Homeostatic Information</em> (1969–70). I found
                    myself positioned and presented as a kinetic artist, which
                    made me feel very uncomfortable because I was doing
                    something quite different. After the show at Hayward, in the
                    early 1970s, I set up the Centre for Behavioural Art at
                    Gallery House, in London, and did the
                    <em>Cognition Control</em> project (1972) at the Museum of
                    Modern Art, in Oxford [now Modern Art Oxford], and Midland
                    Group Gallery, in Nottingham. Around that period, education
                    became part of my life again. I taught in Fine Art
                    Departments, full time at Nottingham&nbsp;College of Art and
                    Design [now&nbsp;Nottingham&nbsp;Trent&nbsp;University] and as visiting
                    lecturer in universities across Exeter, Hornsey, Leeds,
                    Leicester, Liverpool and Newport. I also worked part time at
                    Leicester&nbsp;Polytechnic [now De Montfort University] where I
                    contributed to the ‘Invention of Problems’ symposium they
                    were running in 1971. There were interesting things
                    happening in the Midlands in the early 1970s and,
                    specifically, there was a group of people concerned with
                    what we now call digital art.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> Are there any specific individuals who
                    were based in the UK that have influenced or supported your
                    practice, or who you consider to have made key contributions
                    to the UK digital art ecosystem?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>SW:</strong> To be truthful, I made it because I had
                    this fortunate experience of meeting all these artists very
                    early on. I didn’t really look to any other people for
                    models; I thought I could make my own and did not want to
                    emulate anyone else. Creating and working on
                    <em>The Social Resource Projects</em> (1972–3),
                    <em>The Edinburgh Social Model Construction Project</em>
                    (1973) or <em>Visual Meta Language Simulation</em> (1971–2),
                    and later <em>Meta Filter</em> (1973–5)<em>,</em> was
                    thrilling because nobody’s ever done anything like that
                    before. I believe art should create precedents and move on.
                    Of course, I have met many people throughout my life,
                    especially in the early 1970s when we set up the Centre of
                    Behavioural Art at Gallery House. We had people from
                    different disciplines like the mathematician Robert Bell and
                    George Mallen presenting papers and I met European and Latin
                    American artists.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> We have spoken about some of the
                    communities and groups in the UK that you have been part of,
                    from counter-culture to CAS and the Auto-destructive art
                    group. Could you expand on these and other art communities
                    in the UK and globally that you belong to, that have been
                    influential to the development of your practice?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>SW:</strong> I was very much involved with
                    innovative artists and thinkers that found themselves at the
                    margins of the art world but nevertheless were setting the
                    agenda for the years to come, such as concrete poets, and
                    performance, digital and cybernetic artists. I thought at
                    the time that we were part of a ‘counter consciousness’.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Conversely, I had a lot of problems getting people to
                    understand what I was doing. For example, I thought the work
                    of art did not need the authorship of the artist to transmit
                    meaning. So my work was anonymous. It was process- and
                    event-based instead of object-based. All of these meant that
                    I ended up marginalizing myself from the world of objects
                    and the art market. This became a real problem when, around
                    1973, I found myself completely locked out of the
                    institutional art world. I decided then to embark on work
                    that would change the way art galleries operated by bringing
                    into there inner real problems that mattered for people in
                    the world outside. I wrote a paper in 1973 called
                    <em>The Artist as an Instigator of Changes in Social
                      Cognition and Behaviour,</em>
                    which* presented different models of art operating
                    simultaneously in society. For example, you have educational
                    and remedial art, and all of these models have different
                    languages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Around this period, I began
                    <em>The Edinburgh Social Model Construction Project</em>
                    (1973),* which was made in collaboration with four
                    communities in that city. There was a group of five project
                    operators in each area that went and knocked on people’s
                    doors to introduce the project and distribute a problem
                    sheet in the morning about the way people saw their
                    environment and how they could change it. Around five
                    o’clock each afternoon, they gathered all the sheets and
                    took them to the ICL Centre to upload all the information
                    into mainframe computers. Then the program looked for
                    consensus tendencies within the information and the results
                    were used to produce the following day’s problem situation
                    which meant that we had a very quick series of feedback
                    loops. This exercise lasted for a week, and it was starting
                    to bring people together and to showcase consensus between
                    the communities on how society could function.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After this experience, we realized we could go further and
                    we introduced the project to people passing by, more casual
                    audiences that could intervene directly and add their own
                    responses to the consensus tendencies that were created by a
                    program within a computer terminal outside on the pavement
                    of Princes Street. The computer looked pretty ugly by
                    today’s standards, but people could appreciate and enjoy the
                    unique experience of sitting down on a computer terminal on
                    the street and, responding in a matter of seconds, the
                    machine would start displaying the changes you had produced
                    within the main consensus. This was a profound and powerful
                    experience for people. I see this work as an interface
                    between the analogue qualities of people’s lives and that of
                    digital programming of social situations. The program was
                    constructed by Stuart Pound who is a very famous programmer
                    and concrete poet, and was also a member of CAS.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> As a practitioner with expertise in the
                    field of cybernetics, could you outline some of the key
                    technologies and tools that have made your practice
                    possible?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>SW:</strong> In terms of technology, I did the
                    physical fabrication of the works myself. Chris Grimshaw
                    designed the circuits to my specifications, but then I had
                    to solder them up on circuit boards. Over time, this
                    experience made me an expert at doing this type of work. I
                    was working with really good people, advanced thinkers of
                    the time and marrying the language of their disciplines into
                    the building of a responsive artwork and by doing so,
                    creating a meta-language between the machine and human
                    consciousness. The actual programming tended to be machine
                    language and grey coding. When we came to
                    <em>The Edinburgh Social Model Construction Project,</em> we
                    used the programming language Fortran which relies on
                    machine coding. So, we were actually building dedicated
                    computers from scratch until the work
                    <em>Free Zone</em> (1997) where we decided to use a general
                    computer and we customized it by installing our own program
                    of instructions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Financially, in the main, I funded the work myself. I did
                    not want to institutionalize it because I always thought the
                    artist should be free. When we did the work on social
                    simulations, I spent many months working with local people
                    and for most of these projects I set up advisory panels of
                    experts from all sorts of disciplines like advertising,
                    architecture, cybernetics, mathematics, philosophy and arts.

                    A history of any artistic movement can be read through the
                    spaces that fostered it, and for digital art this is
                    especially true. Inherently breaking new technical ground
                    and operating outside traditional markets, the development
                    of the UK digital art landscape has been reliant on a series
                    of hubs, nodes and networks. Through a series of interviews
                    with 16 artists and curators, this essay looks at the who,
                    what, and where that allowed a national scene to thrive from
                    the 1990s to the present.

                    From grassroot instigators to institutional representatives,
                    the individuals interviewed for this report present through
                    their answers a picture of their personal experience within
                    the field. At the same time it is important to highlight
                    that while many of them are attached to specific art
                    practices or movements, such as net art or media art, they
                    do not necessarily call themselves digital artists or
                    curators because the term is broad.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn1" id="page-coda-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                    The umbrella term ‘digital art’ is applied here in response
                    to the V&amp;A’s Digital Art Collection, on which this
                    research is based, and in order to bring together
                    practitioners from different artistic backgrounds. The
                    interviewees were Heath Bunting, Ruth Catlow (Furtherfield),
                    Alison Craighead (Thomson &amp; Craighead), Sofia Crespo,
                    Nina Davies, Marc Garrett (Furtherfield), Libby Heaney,
                    Zaiba Jabbar (Hervisions), Keiken, Lawrence Lek, Irini
                    Papadimitriou, Anna Ridler, Erica Scourti, Jon Thomson
                    (Thomson &amp; Craighead), Nye Thompson and Kay Watson
                    (Serpentine Galleries).

                    The questionnaire employed here was designed to identify the
                    hubs (spaces), nodes (individuals) and networks that were
                    fundamental to the scenes from which their practices
                    originated. These three elements are positioned within
                    specific periods across each text to evoke particular
                    moments, but in most cases the artists’ work spans decades
                    into the present as well. Additionally, it is worth noting
                    that more than 150 individuals, 40 spaces and 50 networks
                    were mentioned in the responses, but owing to space
                    limitations not all of them have been included. Therefore,
                    this essay can be considered as a first and partial attempt
                    at starting to understand the fundamental factors that have
                    shaped the UK’s digital art ecology in the last three
                    decades.

                    Responding to the growing access to the internet, the 1990s
                    saw the development of a new range of artistic hubs and
                    networks that differed from the organisations of the 1970s
                    and ‘80s. At a time when access to the internet was limited
                    and expensive, venues such as Backspace (1996–9) in Clink
                    Street, London, filled a void by providing an alternative to
                    mainstream cybercafe commerce. Founded by six individuals,
                    including James Stevens, Backspace provided ‘an open
                    environment for exploration and expression on the
                    Internet’<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn2" id="page-coda-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>. Working with the space’s community, invited artists
                    organized events now key to the UK net art scene, including
                    the ‘ANTI WITH E’ lecture series (1997) and the ‘Expo
                    Destructo, Post-Media Flea Market’ (1999), hosted on Charing
                    Cross Road, London. Both events brought together an
                    international community of hacktivists and creatives such as
                    the artists Rachel Baker, Heath Bunting, Pete Gomes, Olia
                    Lialina, Geert Lovink, Cornelia Sollfrank, Alexei Shulgin
                    and the two UK-based collectives Mongrel and Thomson &amp;
                    Craighead. The Arts Technology Centre (Artec) (1990–2001),
                    located in Islington, London, was equally important as a
                    point of access to technology. Established in 1990 with the
                    support of the European Commission’s London Initiative,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn3" id="page-coda-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                    Artec is known as the first centre for creative applications
                    of digital technology in the UK. Its programme supported
                    artists through residencies and commissions, in addition to
                    delivering training courses for young and long-term
                    unemployed people. Some of its early staff members include
                    the producer Frank Boyd and the artists Derek Richards and
                    Graham Harwood. From that appointment, Harwood went on to
                    co-found the collective Mongrel (1995–2008)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn4" id="page-coda-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>

                    Working more nomadically and founded both on and offline,
                    artist-led organizations such as Furtherfield
                    (1996–present), co-founded by artists Ruth Catlow and Marc
                    Garrett, have been pivotal for reclaiming network
                    technologies as tools for hacktivist critique and artistic
                    collaborative practice. Catlow viewed the internet as a
                    ‘hybrid machine-societal context for art making’<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn6" id="page-coda-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                    where objects could be shaped simultaneously by audiences
                    and artists, moving away from the traditional view of
                    artworks as objects owned and displayed in gallery spaces.
                    Similarly, Garrett saw the internet as a means of ‘creating
                    a shared imaginative context’<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn7" id="page-coda-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                    where people could learn new skills to collectively build a
                    different reality. Their ethos echoed the sentiment of a
                    generation of creatives that were eager to produce new
                    distribution channels that could challenge the consumerist
                    status quo of the mass media and its control over public
                    space.

                    At a time in which net art had little or no recognition
                    within the institutional art establishment, these grassroot
                    spaces were important in fuelling international
                    collaboration and nurturing a creative community. Supporting
                    all of this activity, a range of online networks formed
                    through mailing lists and Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) to
                    enable people to interact and share their activities.
                    Examples include the World Wide Web Newsletter (1993–4)
                    created by the technologist Ivan Pope at Goldsmiths College
                    [Now Goldsmiths, University of London],<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn8" id="page-coda-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                    and the cybercafe BBS (1994-96), run by the artists Rachel
                    Baker, Heath Bunting and Marc Garret. Cybercafe was the
                    forerunner of Furtherfield and the web server irational.org
                    (1996–2006),<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn9" id="page-coda-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                    which Bunting founded and invited artists Daniel G. Andújar,
                    Rachel Baker, Kayle Brandon, Minerva Cuevas and Marcus
                    Valentine to be part of. Other online key spaces for
                    exchange and critique were <em>Mute</em> magazine
                    (1994–present), founded by the artists Pauline van Mourik
                    Broekman and Simon Worthington, and the Europe based mailing
                    lists Nettime (1995–present), Syndicate (1996–2001) and
                    Rhizome (1996–present).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn10" id="page-coda-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                    The latter became an organization dedicated to born-digital
                    art and affiliated in 2003 with the New Museum of
                    Contemporary Art, New York.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mainstream art spaces responded to these activities too, for
                    example Tate started a series of net artwork commissions
                    (2000–12) with Graham Harwood’s&nbsp;<em>Uncomfortable Proximity</em>
                    and Simon Patterson’s&nbsp;<em>Le Match des Couleurs</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn11" id="page-coda-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                    Similarly, the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), London,
                    opened its New Media Centre in 1998 and appointed curator
                    Benjamin Weil as its director. Smaller organizations such as
                    Merseyside Moviola,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn12" id="page-coda-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                    which produced the UK’s largest international video-art
                    festival Video Positive (1989–2000) in partnership with Tate
                    Liverpool, formed into FACT Liverpool in 2003, an arts venue
                    that has continued championing the presentation of emerging
                    artists working with film and digital technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite the growing institutional interest in digital art,
                    most activities continued to be developed by independent
                    organizations and artist-led spaces into the 2000s. Kay
                    Watson, currently Head of Arts Technologies at&nbsp;Serpentine
                    Galleries, London, highlights that ‘the community around
                    artist-run spaces and experimental project spaces in London
                    was key in the early 2000s and 2010s.’<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn13" id="page-coda-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                    Following the DIY (Do-it-Yourself) attitudes of rave culture
                    in the UK in the 1990s,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn14" id="page-coda-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                    experimental festivals dedicated to arts and digital culture
                    emerged such as Futuresonic (1996–2009, now Future
                    Everything) in Manchester;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn15" id="page-coda-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                    the DMZ Media Arts Festival taking place at Limehouse Town
                    Hall, London (14–15 November 2003); NODE.London (2006–21);
                    Abandon Normal Devices (2009–present) in Liverpool;
                    Electromagnetic Field (2012–present) in Ledbury; and Mediale
                    (2014–present), in York. These festivals have brought
                    together an international community of artists and
                    technologists, and were important in producing new languages
                    with which to understand the post-internet digital
                    condition.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn16" id="page-coda-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                    They also served as sites of exchange where groups could
                    raise awareness of how people could reclaim technologies
                    despite the increasing corporatization of the internet.
                    Irini Papadimitriou, currently Director of Exhibitions at
                    Diriyah Art Futures, Riyadh, explains that the free and
                    open-source software (FOSS)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn17" id="page-coda-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                    and collective prototyping culture present at these events
                    were what inspired her to launch the V&amp;A’s Digital
                    Design Weekend (2011–present)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn18" id="page-coda-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>. Other relevant event-based networks that emerged during
                    this period were Dorkbot London (2001–present),<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn19" id="page-coda-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                    which has hosted more than 244 speakers over the years
                    including artists Beatrice Gibson, Amy Alexander and
                    Wojciech Kosma, and Algorave (2011–present),<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn20" id="page-coda-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                    which has developed an expansive international network of
                    practitioners including artist Ivan Abreu, composer
                    Alexandra Cárdenas and AI and music researcher Norah Lorway.
                    Dorkbot brought a community of creatives together to
                    showcase work in progress, while Algorave combined sound and
                    visual experimentations in live coding sessions.

                    Complementing the creative networking opportunities
                    generated through these events, online modes of
                    dissemination maintained popularity. Key examples from this
                    period are Furtherfield’s NetBehaviour (2003–present) and
                    the Curatorial Resource for Upstart Media Bliss (CRUMB)
                    (2000–24), founded by curators Sarah Cook and Beryl Graham.
                    CRUMB was based at the University of Sunderland and as a
                    mailing list it operated both as a critical space and a
                    resource for practitioners interested in curating media art.
                    Other universities followed suit in formalizing their
                    support towards media practices: Goldsmiths, University of
                    London, founded its MA Computational Arts programme in 2004
                    and Newcastle University opened its Culture Lab in 2006.
                    These spaces have nurtured new generations of creatives and
                    incentivized interdisciplinary approaches to digital
                    technologies. Comparably, non-profit educational spaces such
                    as Access Space (2000–present) in Sheffield, where artist
                    Jake Harris has directed the Art &amp; Innovation programme
                    since 2007, and London Hack Space (2009–present), founded by
                    software engineers Russ Garrett and Jonty Wareing,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn21" id="page-coda-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                    have been important venues to provide technological access
                    and training outside of academic frameworks. Alongside those
                    venues, NEoN Digital Arts (2009–present) in Dundee, directed
                    by curator Donna Holford-Lovell, and Vivid Projects
                    (2012–present) in Birmingham, originated by curator Yasmeen
                    Baig-Clifford, have offered important skills-developed
                    programming in addition to exhibitions and events.

                  <p>
                    Following the post-internet turn, artists increasingly
                    sought to express the material qualities of digital
                    networks, driving a need for studios and artist-led spaces
                    specializing in physically presenting media artworks to live
                    audiences. Existing studio organization SPACE, in London,
                    opened a programme titled Media Arts (2005–11), which was
                    run by creative Gini Simpson (2003–8) and thanks to the
                    curator Rachel Falconer (2013–6) developed other digitally
                    focused strands of activity. Furthermore, arebyte Gallery
                    (2013–present), founded by Nimrod Vardi, mixes studio
                    complex and innovative digital art exhibitions, and Somerset
                    House Studios (2015–present), founded by creative producer
                    Marie McPartlin, would become a geographically central site
                    of digital art thanks to its fabrication lab facilities and
                    advisory services.

                    Complementing the new type of studios mentioned above were
                    artist-led galleries that created exhibition and screening
                    opportunities in London. Examples include Lima Zulu
                    (2000–16) in Manor House, co-run by curator Ben Vickers;
                    Banner Repeater (2010–present) in Hackney Downs train
                    station, founded by artist Ami Clarke; and Gossamer Fog
                    (2016–present), founded by artist Samuel Capps in Deptford,
                    which has recently launched a virtual production studio. At
                    the same time, certain studios have also been key in
                    incubating more spontaneous and inventive events, such as
                    the series of Bring Your Own Beamer (BYOB) one-night
                    exhibitions hosted by SPACE Media Arts in 2013 and 2017,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn22" id="page-coda-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                    in which artists projected their interactive projects to an
                    informal audience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Running in parallel to these various efforts, art
                    institutions created new posts and launched more
                    experimental programmes to present the work of artists
                    exploring the social effects of network technology. Examples
                    include the curated club nights organized by the ICA’s
                    Director of Live and Digital, Vivienne Gaskin (1996–2006);
                    the inaugural appointment of Katrina Sluis as Senior Curator
                    of Digital Programmes at the Photographers’ Gallery
                    (2011–9); the launch of the Open Data Institute’s (ODI) Data
                    as Culture art programme (2014–present), directed by Hannah

                    Taking place alongside these in-person activities was the
                    development of social-media platforms such as Facebook
                    (2004), YouTube (2005), Tumblr (2007) and Instagram (2011).
                    The popularity of these platforms amongst creatives grew
                    rapidly due to their potential to serve as both a motif and
                    medium for social critique, while working as sites for
                    exhibitions and peer-to-peer exchange. From 2015, multiple
                    online artistic platforms and networks emerged in the UK
                    including Digital Artist Residency(2015–22),<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn25" id="page-coda-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>

                    Based in the UK, but with an international outreach, these
                    platforms created a new space for an emerging generation of
                    artists. Additionally, Hervisions (2015–present)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn34" id="page-coda-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                    and Digi-Gxl (2019–present)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn35" id="page-coda-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                    originated to support femme identify and non-binary artists
                    specifically as a way to combat an historically
                    male-dominated art scene. Overseas, the Wrong Biennale<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-coda-fn36" id="page-coda-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                    (2013–present), based in Spain, was a key international
                    network established to motivate some of the above spaces to
                    produce nomadic physical events and exhibitions, in addition
                    to their online programmes. These activities motivated more
                    established organizations to produce a consistent online
                    programme to complement their onsite activities, for example
                    the Photographers’ Gallery’s ‘Screen Walks’ series
                    (2020–present), which was produced in collaboration with the
                    Fotomuseum Winterthur, Switzerland; and arebyte Gallery’s
                    open-call initiative ‘arebyte on Screen’ (2019–present).

                    Finally, in the early 2010s London commercial galleries
                    started to identify the potential of artistic practices
                    dedicated to digital culture. Caroll/Fletcher (2012–7),
                    founded by Jonathon Carroll and Steve Fletcher, and Gazelli
                    Art House (2010–present), founded by Mila Askarova, are
                    examples of galleries that have supported experimental
                    practices and bridged between artists from different
                    generations through consistent online and onsite
                    programming. Around that period, the Lumen Prize for Art and
                    Technology was founded by Carla Rapoport to recognize
                    artists working with technologies and to raise awareness of
                    their practices. More recently, with the rising interest in
                    the blockchain and Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs), other types
                    of commercial spaces such as VERSE.Works (2022–present) have
                    emerged to develop a sales model that combines physical
                    exhibitions and events with transactions on the blockchain.
                    Similarly, through GAZELLI.iO (2015–present), Gazelli Art
                    House has produced sales of artworks on the blockchain while
                    developing residencies and dedicated project spaces for
                    digital and virtual reality (VR) art. Lastly, other UK-based
                    networks have formed to produce forums to discuss issues
                    around ownership and the blockchain, for example the Digital
                    Art Salon (2022–3) and Right Click Save Magazine
                    (2022–present).

                  <p>
                    By reflecting back on the past 30 years, it can be observed
                    that the UK’s digital art ecology has four principal pillars
                    of distinctive activity. The first is characterized by DIY
                    community spaces such as Backspace, London Hack Space and
                    Vivid Projects, which have provided access to technologies
                    and training opportunities for creatives. These venues have
                    encouraged a critical approach to technologies and generated
                    informal research strategies. In the same way, at the time
                    of writing, universities are developing programmes dedicated
                    to more experimental prototyping and research – some
                    examples are University College London’s new BA in Art and
                    Technology; University of the Arts London’s Creative
                    Computing Institute; Manchester Metropolitan University’s
                    School of Digital Arts; and University of Plymouth’s PhD in
                    Digital Art and Technology. The second pillar pertains to
                    experimental exhibition spaces such as Furtherfield, Lima
                    Zulu, arebyte Gallery, isthistit? and Somerset House
                    Studios. These spaces allow artists to obtain necessary
                    support to create new work and to generate peer-to-peer
                    networks, in addition to pioneering inventive ways to
                    present digital art practices to the general public. The
                    third pillar comprises event-based communities exemplified
                    by events and festivals such as Algorave, Abandon Normal
                    Devices and Electromagnetic Field. These events are relevant
                    to the aim of presenting emerging artistic practices to a
                    wider audience and to enable artists to showcase their work
                    within a more experiential and relaxed setting. The fourth
                    pillar is formed of commercial spaces such as
                    Caroll/Fletcher, Gazelli Art House and VERSE.works, which
                    have been pivotal in establishing a market for digital
                    artistic practices and supporting artists to factor in the
                    legacy of their work. Atop these pillars sits institutional
                    recognition, which has been essential to bringing these
                    communities of practice to a wider audience.

                          Pope coined the term ‘cybercafe’ in March 1994 while
                          preparing to take part in the symposium ‘Towards the
                          Aesthetics of the Future’ (12–13 March 1994) held at
                          the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), London. The
                          event explored the connections between culture,
                          society, politics and the impact upon them of new
                          digital processes and technologies.

                    This research project was developed between January 2023 and
                    June 2024 at the V&amp;A with the support of the Paul Mellon
                    Centre for Studies in British Art.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I would like to thank all the individuals that provided
                    their time, expertise and advice, without them
                    <em>Hubs, Nodes and Networks</em> would not have been
                    possible. Foremost, to my former colleagues at the V&amp;A,
                    I am immensely grateful to Corinna Gardner and Shoshanna
                    Isaacson for their continuous support and brilliant
                    guidance; to Joanna Norman, Christopher Turner and Tom
                    Windross, I would like to express my gratitude for trusting
                    in this project, despite its experimental nature; and
                    special thanks to Claudia Heidebluth, Nazek Ghaddar and
                    Amber Redican for the brilliance they brought to the
                    administrative coordination. This project would not be the
                    same without Donata Miller-Obebe’s advice and diligent image
                    research, nor would it have been possible without Alexia
                    Kirk’s help accessing the V&amp;A’s CAS archive. And to my
                    peers at the museum, Marc Barto, Carrie Chan, Natalie Kane,
                    Anna Mladentseva, Katherine Mitchell, Livia Turnbull and
                    William Seung, your expert knowledge on digital art
                    practices has been an invaluable resource over the past
                    years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Special thanks goes to the artists and curators who trust me
                    with their stories and took part on the research including
                    Heath Bunting, Ruth Catlow, Analivia Cordeiro, Alison
                    Craighead, Sofía Crespo, Nina Davies, Ernest Edmonds, Marc
                    Garrett, Libby Heaney, Zaiba Jabbar, Keiken, William Latham,
                    Lawrence Lek, John Lifton, Irini Papadimitriou, Anna Ridler,
                    Erica Scourti, Jon Thomson, Nye Thompson, Kay Watson and

                    My understanding of data visualisation owes a debt to Dr.
                    Jin Gao and Dr. Bonnie Buyuklieva from University College
                    London’s Department of Information Studies. Their direction
                    helped to organise the findings from the CAS archive into a
                    map showcasing global networks. While the data visualization
                    developer Mengying Du has helped to bring these ideas to
                    life via a dynamic interactive model.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I am extremely grateful for Ariella Yedgar’s meticulous copy
                    editing, support and patience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This project would not exist without the generosity of Jasia
                    Reichardt and Felix Mittelberger who, respectively, allowed
                    me access to their personal archive and the ZKM | Center for
                    Art and Media Karlsruhe archives. As well as the individuals
                    and organisations who provided the images illustrating these
                    texts and directed me towards references I would not have
                    discovered alone. Many thanks to Bob Bicknell-Knight, Paul
                    Brown, Robert Devčić, Dunja Donassy-Bonačić, Cécile B.

                    Society, Rebecca Tropp, Kathleen Ward, Whitechapel Gallery
                    and Pamela Zoline. Finally, to my husband Elliott Burns,
                    thank you for your love and support.
