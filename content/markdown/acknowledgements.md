This research project was developed between January 2023 and June 2024 at the V&A with the support of the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art. 

I would like to thank all the individuals that provided their time, expertise and advice, without them *Hubs, Nodes and Networks* would not have been possible. Foremost, to my former colleagues at the V&A, I am immensely grateful to Corinna Gardner and Shoshanna Isaacson for their continuous support and brilliant guidance; to Joanna Norman, Christopher Turner and Tom Windross, I would like to express my gratitude for trusting in this project, despite its experimental nature; and special thanks to Claudia Heidebluth, Nazek Ghaddar and Amber Redican for the brilliance they brought to the administrative coordination. This project would not be the same without Donata Miller-Obebe’s advice and diligent image research, nor would it have been possible without Alexia Kirk’s help accessing the V&A’s CAS archive. And to my peers at the museum, Marc Barto, Carrie Chan, Natalie Kane, Anna Mladentseva, Katherine Mitchell, Livia Turnbull and William Seung, your expert knowledge on digital art practices has been an invaluable resource over the past years.

Special thanks goes to the artists and curators who trust me with their stories and took part on the research including Heath Bunting, Ruth Catlow, Analivia Cordeiro, Alison Craighead, Sofía Crespo, Nina Davies, Ernest Edmonds, Marc Garrett, Libby Heaney, Zaiba Jabbar, Keiken, William Latham, Lawrence Lek, John Lifton, Irini Papadimitriou, Anna Ridler, Erica Scourti, Jon Thomson, Nye Thompson, Kay Watson and Stephen Willats. 

My understanding of data visualisation owes a debt to Dr. Jin Gao and Dr. Bonnie Buyuklieva from University College London’s Department of Information Studies. Their direction helped to organise the findings from the CAS archive into a map showcasing global networks. While the data visualization developer Mengying Du has helped to bring these ideas to life via a dynamic interactive model.

I am extremely grateful for Ariella Yedgar’s meticulous copy editing, support and patience. 

This project would not exist without the generosity of Jasia Reichardt, Felix Mittelberger and Christian Platz who, respectively, allowed me access to their personal archive and the ZKM | Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe archives. As well as the individuals and organisations who provided the images illustrating these texts and directed me towards references I would not have discovered alone. Many thanks to Bob Bicknell-Knight, Paul Brown, Robert Devčić, Dunja Donassy-Bonačić, Cécile B. Evans, Ella Fleming, Future Everything, Gossamer Fog, Nick Lambert, Andrey Lazarev, Jon R. Luini, Catherine Mason, Margit Rosen, SPACE, James Stevens, Tate, The Computer Arts Society, Rebecca Tropp, Kathleen Ward, Whitechapel Gallery and Pamela Zoline. Finally, to my husband Elliott Burns, thank you for your love and support.
