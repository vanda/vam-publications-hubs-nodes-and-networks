**Pita Arreola:** Reflecting on the beginning of your career, could you elaborate on your earliest encounters with computer art and how you came to incorporate certain methodologies and technologies into your practice?  

**Analivia Cordeiro:** When I presented my work *M3x3* in 1973, I was only 19 years old. I did not have any formal training or academic links to the field of technology. I learned how to program computers through books. More importantly, I was a professional dancer. I have been dancing since I was seven years old. This has given me a complex understanding of the vocabulary and language of body movements. 

In 1973, my life radically changed when my father, the artist Waldemar Cordeiro, passed away unexpectedly in his sleep at the age of 48. But I continued my work and in August that year, I premiered *M3x3* at the ‘INTERACT. Man: Machine: Society’* exhibition and conference which was part of the Edinburgh International Festival. I did not attend the event, but I sent the film by post with the paper 'A Language for Dance’ (1973) which is part of the V&A collection. The architect John Lansdown presented the paper and the film on my behalf at the conference.



During 1974, I was invited to be part of a seminar for the Art and Science programme at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem which was organized by the cybernetician and computer artist Vladimir Bonačić. It was an interesting experience because I was by far the youngest person attending. I met the artist John Whitney who was 72 at that time and became friends with the artist Herbert Franke. His English was not good and mine was worse, but we developed a nice friendship. When I came back to Brazil, we exchanged letters, and communicating by post took months of course. 

I also had a very good relationship with the cybernetician Gordon Pask. He was a very intelligent person with a flexible mind. I had dinner at his house, and we talked about education. I only met John Lansdown once and we did not have the time to discuss culture, but in 1977 he wrote a paper about computers and choreography, and he mentioned my practice as an example of pioneering work.** 

**PA:** Since early on in your career, you have taken part in different events and exhibitions such as ‘INTERACT. Machine: Man: Society’ (1973), organized by the Computer Arts Society (CAS) for the Edinburgh International Festival; the ‘Latin America 74’ exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA), London (1973); and the ‘Art and Science’ programme at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, Jerusalem (1974). Could you tell us about these and other events that were both memorable and important in establishing the circle that your practice originates from, or that further raised the profile of your community of practice?

**AC:** I was somewhat isolated in Brazil. I had little money after my father's death, so I couldn’t travel much. I travelled intellectually, but not physically. But in a way, I had many freedoms in my work because I was not connected to a university or company. 

Those exhibitions, especially ‘INTERACT. Machine: Man: Society’*,* were fundamental for my career. I was very young when I sent my proposal to CAS, but they accepted it and sent me an invitation to be part of the exhibition by post. I took the letter to the broadcaster TV Cultura in Brazil and asked them for support. The director was astonished that I had received an invitation to present my work at an international arts festival. It took some convincing, but she agreed to speak to the committee and after 10 days they confirmed their support. Without Lansdown and the exhibition, I would have never been able to develop *M3x3*. 

For the recording of this video, a computer generated the instructions to assemble the scenes, so the TV director did not have much work to do. The dancers were aware of how to direct their movements towards the cameras positioned at the front, top and sides of the stage. For the final edition, I asked them to use a high contrast of black and white, so the images could aesthetically respond to computer binaries, 0s and 1s, as well as merge the body with the scene. They were reluctant at first, but they ended up accepting my request.

After that, I met Jorge Glusberg, director of Centro de Arte y Comunicación (CAyC), in Buenos Aires. He selected the work of artists, including mine, and presented it in New York and across Europe in countries like Italy, Belgium and France, and in London at the ICA. These exhibitions raised awareness of the exchanges between art and technology and presented the aesthetic propositions of a collective of artists. CAS and CAyC cemented the foundations of today’s digital art practices. I was very lucky to be part of those groups. 

**PA:** Around the period these events took place, the early 1970s, what specific vocabulary was being used to describe digital art? It would be good to hear about that, considering how terminologies have been used and changed across different periods.   

**AC:** At the beginning there were two main terms: ‘computer art’ and ‘computer-aided art’. Computer art applied to works where the output was directly generated by the computer, like a plotter drawing. Computer-aided art described work where the computer produced the instructions for humans to translate and execute. In this type of art form, the final artwork is the human interpretation. Over time, the latter term disappeared; we don’t have a distinction any more between computer- and human-decoded outputs. 

My work also included video, which fell under ‘multimedia art’, a term that came after ‘computer art’. Gradually, the whole movement evolved into a moment when it was called ‘art and technology’. Nowadays, everybody uses technology. The term ‘digital’ sits in opposition to ‘analogue’, and at this point in time the analogue seems Palaeolithic and has disappeared. ‘Digital art’ emerges from computer art and should be used to describe artists who are really questioning the relationship between humans and technology. Using digital tools is not enough anymore. We are now immersed in technology and unable to experience reality without technology. 

Additionally, our visual capacity changes over time. It relies on the stimuli we receive and our physiology. We see things differently than we used to see them last century. Today, there are two prominent phenomena that contemporary art should address. The first is the constancy of change, and the second is the excessive abundance of visual imagery. In my view, what matters today is not the individual artwork, but the visual structure that it proposes. ‘Generative art’ produces thousands of examples of the same visual structure, and each example is a variation of this structure. In this type of work, the audience’s role shifts from selecting a specific artwork to rationally understanding the visual structure because it is very difficult to choose one image since they all seem similar, but each one is different from the other. The images appear similar but they are never the same. 

Digital art is no longer sufficient to address this type of art, and it could be called instead ‘post-digital art’ which could also be described as ‘probabilistic’ or ‘structural digital art’. Probability here refers to rapid and constant change. This attitude can be defined as a ‘quantum posture’, where things are in continuous flux, passing through a position for a fraction of a second and we are only able to perceive and experience their constant change. To create work in this context means that images are constantly being generated and their physical representation is the structure in time. Because of this, time is central to the concept of structural art. I’m trying to explain here what will be implicit in future works of art that will originate from ‘computer art’ that existed 60 years ago.  



Future spectators will be challenged to understand and visually absorb this structure, but visualisation is changing, and we will change. People will need more accuracy to understand and memorize similar images.**


**PA:** Over the years, you have collaborated with different individuals across the UK and internationally, including Vladimir Bonačić, John Lansdown and Nilton Lobo. Could you tell us about these collaborations and the expertise they have brought to your practice?  

**AC:** As I mentioned, Lansdown was fundamental: his invitation to ‘INTERACT’ and the collaboration that generated was what brought me into this world. Before him, I met Bonačić. He came to Brazil in 1971 for the exhibition ‘Arteônica’ that my father organized in São Paulo. I was then a first-year student at the Architecture and Urbanism College at the University of São Paulo. During his visit, I showed him mathematical visual studies that I had done utilizing lines and dots. He then introduced me to the concept of random choice which was shaping the aesthetic of that moment and was very important for programming my work. These ideas helped me consider how to program my choreographies defining the different body positions.

I went to New York in 1977 and studied under the dancer and choreographer Merce Cunningham. After that, I came back to Brazil and developed the second phase of my work dedicated to the notation of movement. It is unbelievable but still today there is not an established efficient and easy method to write movements like we have with music. Over the years, dance history has been lost because of this reason. At that point, I was looking for a collaborator and went to the University of São Paulo. In January 1983, the director of the Computer Science Department introduced me to the engineer Nilton Lobo. We began our collaboration, and we got married in 1993. We now have a son who is part of our family research unit. 

The first thing that I have to say is that I consider Nilton a co-author, because technical experts not only support the work, but they also shape the work with their perspective. They give the work future possibilities. I believe all artists should consider technicians as co-authors.

In the beginning, I had a vision of programming human movement into the computer. The work we have done is pioneering motion capture, as there was nothing available to do this before. To be a pioneer means that you find ways to transform ideas that do not exist into reality. Through our research on trajectory notation, I studied the single frames of a film and identified 24 joints of the body’s limbs per frame. The video contained 30 frames per second and this exercise produced thousands of body movements. Nilton made the program that transformed that information into 2D figures that we used to generate 3D computer figures. This whole process resulted in a motion-capture system called Nota-Anna.**


**PA:**  Beyond networks of digital art that we’ve mentioned, you’ve also circulated amongst communities of dance. Could you tell us about how these differ or what they bring?

**AC:** I have always considered myself a dancer. Dance communities are very distinct from others because we have a strict lifestyle. To be a dancer is like being an athlete. We are very disciplined. We are not able to go out at night and get drunk, because the next morning we cannot work well. 

**PA:** As a practitioner with expertise in the fields of algorithmic choreography and architecture of movement, could you outline some of the key technologies and tools that have made your practice possible?    

**AC:** I mostly use video in my work. At the beginning, I did not have a plotter, so I drew by hand the six numbers of a vector that represent the body position in the printed output of the computer dance. I used plotters when they became available. Then later, the operating system Windows, which I found to be great because you could store different information and it gave you the ability to multitask. The internet changed everything and gave us the opportunity to communicate with more people. When video was integrated into the internet, the space became a paradise. 

In terms of software, Photoshop created great freedom and QuickTime allowed the editing process in video to become home-made. These technological tools empowered individuals but people have become slaves to the technology. I am not driven by technology. I use it when it makes sense to me. I have incorporated all the new technologies into my work because it made the research easier and because of the possibilities it opened to develop our first dream of finding a way to write and create movement. Today, the challenge for people is to find a personal space that allows them to express themselves. Technology obliges us to follow too many rules to communicate, we should have more space to find our personal way of communicating.


**PA:** It would be interesting to hear about the thinkers and theoretical concepts that have helped shape your work.

**AC:** Historically, Brazil was not a technology driven country, but I had my father. When he was alive, he gave me access to information and books about computer art and theorists like the engineer and philosopher Abraham Moles. These ideas provided me with a clear direction to understand technological contexts and my place within them. Another theorist is Jonathan Benthall from the ICA, London, who had a very unique and humanistic perspective about technology and culture. His book *Science and Technology in Art Today* (1972) was very influential for the field. 

Additionally, I had a very special education with the choreographer Maria Duschenes under the Rudolf Laban dance method. Laban was a theoretician who analyzed the language of human body movement through its elements and established the relationship between those elements. He was very important to my work, because this method allowed me to understand body movements in order to program them on the computer.

Another influential figure was the artist, designer and choreographer Oskar Schlemmer, who was a tutor at the Bauhaus. I love his work. One day, Mrs Duschenes took us to see the film of his *Triadic Ballet* from 1922 at the Goethe Institut, in São Paulo, and I started intuitively learning from his work by dancing and imitating the movement of his dancers. When I was 12, I also met the artist John Cage, and Merce Cunningham. These artistic experiences and my research drove me to seek new aesthetics. I think that a new media requires a new aesthetic. You can see these new languages of video and body movements in my three videos *M3x3*, *0=45°* (1974)* and *Cambiantes* (1976). 

**PA:** Finally, could you speak about the conceptual framework of your work and how it has evolved over the years?

**AC:** The goal of computer art in the 1970s was to establish a dialogue between technology and society. Computers represented a bright future for a new society that would be more egalitarian, with people having more free time. It is not exactly what happened, or is not our reality today, but the energy was very positive. Artists were trying to understand how to translate the language of arts into a computer. In my case, I was looking for ways to translate elements of choreography and body expression so these could be programmed by a computer. Nowadays, we have the opposite problem, we need to take people's activities away from computers.

Artists were part of a counter-culture movement and many questions that emerged during that time are still relevant and unresolved today. Counter-culture was very important, and it is something that the group exhibition ‘Coded: Art Enters the Computer Age’ (2023) at Los Angeles County Museum of Art showcased very successfully. This movement was killed by big corporations like IBM and Siemens who started to pay artists to create with their products. 

At first glance, you can think that I was trying to solve practical problems of how to coordinate the video camera with human movement in dance production. That was one of the objectives of my early research, but the second phase focused on how to write body movements. Behind these practical problems there is deeper research concerning the future of humans and the behaviour of humans with technology. In *M3x3* I approached this question by establishing body positions through notational figures. The dancers then learnt the positions and created the link between the positions in order to produce the choreography. In this way, the dancers were emotionally involved by making individual decisions on the movements and could express themselves creating the transitions between positions. I never saw the dancer in this process as an animation or an avatar. 

Nowadays, the challenge for younger generations is how to exist and express themselves individually in the middle of the infinite stream of rules that manage our daily lives. For example, today you must fit all your messages inside the rectangular shape of screens, otherwise you lose them. This is a big limitation for our brain. If I owned a technology company, I would invent and distribute screens in round, square and polygonal shapes, so people could be freer to feed their ideas to the screen. 

Another element that is important to my work is spontaneity: I always propose to people to act as they feel in their own time, which gives them the freedom to find their own possibilities. This idea was presented in my show ‘From Body to Code’ (2023) at ZKM (Center for Art and Media, Karlsruhe) where we had motion-capture works that proposed to people ways to find their own pace and movements.

A final element of my work is the relationship between humans and their surroundings. In my first work *M3x3*, I merged the human body with the scene as a way to signify that we are one with nature. This is an idea that I applied to succeeding artworks. Through my work, I invite the audience not to oppose the environment but to work with it. Some people destroy the environment for profit, but there is a limit to what money can provide if we don’t have a proper natural world.
