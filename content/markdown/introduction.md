*Hubs, Nodes and Networks: A New History of British Digital Art*, examines the spaces and people that enabled computational and digital art in the twentieth and twenty first century with the aim of representing the collective effort that has enabled this field of art to succeed.

Traditionally, art history has represented artistic movements through the lens of masterpieces and their creators. Less research has centred on the back-of-house elements that have enabled creative individuals to develop their work. One such element are the meeting spaces for artistic communities, which have always been fundamental to their development. Historic examples include the nightclub Cabaret Voltaire, in Zurich, which was pivotal for Dada in the 1910s, and the writer Gertrude Stein’s Parisian apartment, a key place for Modernism in Europe during the first half of the twentieth century. This research project, titled *Hubs, Nodes and Networks: A New History of British Digital Art,* re-examines the relevance of such spaces to the fostering of computational and digital art in contemporary culture, as well as the people behind them, with the aim of representing the collective effort that has enabled this field of art to succeed.

The term ‘digital art’ is applied across this research to refer to artistic practices engaging conceptually and technically with computational processes, in addition to connecting the project with the V&A’s Digital Art Collection where the research stems from. The project reviews the development of digital art in the United Kingdom from the 1960s to the present day, focusing on three main elements that have contributed to the formation of a thriving digital art ecology in the region: artistic hubs, nodes and networks. In the context of this project, ‘hubs’ have been defined as localities that could be physical or digital, permanent or temporal, where individuals gather; ‘nodes’ are individuals who produce connections and might be affiliated with certain hubs or networks; and ‘networks’ are the communities, declared or loosely correlated, that sit across the hubs and nodes. Additionally, the research considers as a baseline the V&A’s Computer Arts Society (CAS) Archive and Collection (1968–85) – a key resource to understanding in depth the 1960s beginnings of digital art in the UK and abroad. A major significance of the archive and collection lies in the overview they provide of the global networks that the society held with other international communities, exploring the use of computers in creative practice and how knowledge was exchanged in a pre-internet era. Finding this type of notable content was what inspired the project and drove an interest in reflecting on the contemporary history of artistic networks within the field of digital art.

CAS was founded in 1968 by the architect John Lansdown, cybernetician George Mallen and engineer Alan Sutcliffe with the purpose of ‘encouraging the creative use of computers in the arts and allowing the exchange of information in this area’.<sup>[^1]</sup> The society was formed after the show ‘Cybernetic Serendipity’, curated by Jasia Reichardt in 1968 at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), London. Reichardt’s exhibition demonstrated through the work of 130 artists and scientists how post-war technologies could be applied for creative purposes. Both Mallen and Sutcliffe were part of the show. Mallen worked with the cybernetician Gordon Pask to produce the work *The Colloquy of Mobiles* (1968), while Sutcliffe took part with the composer Peter Zinovieff and the Electronic Music Studios (EMS). The first iteration of CAS, which is represented by the V&A’s holdings, was active from 1968 to ‘85 and developed workshops, events and regular gatherings, in addition to generating exchange through its *PAGE* bulletin, where international exhibitions, events, resources, news, reviews and articles were published and distributed to its members. By 1974, the society had 192 members including the writer and systems engineer Jonathan Benthall, cybernetic sculptor Edward Ihnatowicz and Jasia Reichardt. Key to CAS’s global reach were the networks based at Centro de Arte y Comunicación (CAYC) (Buenos Aires), the New Tendencies Group (Zagreb) and the group Experiments with Art and Technology (E.A.T.) at Bell Laboratories (New Jersey). These groups are represented in the V&A’s collection through the work of such artists as Eduardo Mac Entyre, Norma Tamburini, Marc Adrian, A. Michael Noll and Lillian Schwartz.

This research project was developed using a mixed methodological approach that sought to gather data on hubs, nodes and networks in order to map the evolution of digital art in the UK yet with an international perspective that indicates how ideas have been globally exchanged. This methodology includes conducting primary research in the V&A’s CAS Archive and Collection as well as in the Tate archives, ZKM | Center for Art and Media archives and the personal archive of Jasia Reichardt. The V&A’s archive is composed of 29 boxes. In addition to material related to CAS activities, the archive contains memorabilia from international exhibitions and events, John Lansdown and George Mallen’s correspondence, newspaper cut-outs, magazines, artist sketches and texts, and technological brochures. Tate’s and the ZKM’s holdings expand on certain artists, while Reichardt’s tracks her curatorial interactions with many key figures in the field, both in the UK and overseas. Research also included oral interviews with five artists (1960s to ‘80s) whose stories are interwoven with that of CAS and represented in the V&A’s archive, including Analivia Cordeiro, Ernest Edmonds, William Latham, John Lifton and Stephen Willats. These extended conversations were complemented by a programme of structured interviews with representatives of the 1990s to 2020s that featured qualitative and quantitative questions and were carried out in a combination of digital surveys and direct interviews. In this component, 16 artists and curators that have contributed to the formation of the UK’s contemporary digital art landscape were featured, including Heath Bunting, Ruth Catlow (Furtherfield), Alison Craighead (Thomson & Craighead), Sofia Crespo, Nina Davies, Marc Garrett (Furtherfield), Libby Heaney, Zaiba Jabbar (Hervisions), Keiken, Lawrence Lek, Irini Papadimitriou, Anna Ridler, Erica Scourti, Jon Thompson (Thomson & Craighead), Nye Thompson, and Kay Watson (Serpentine Galleries). Data from the archives and the interviews was identified, compiled and categorized in a data set to determine which types of events and networks have enabled the formation of digital art in the UK. The purpose of understanding the history of digital art in this way is to track and map directly from the data the relationships between individuals and organisations. These data points were systematically organized according to the roles of individuals (e.g. artist, composer, curator), their networks and work media (e.g. film, performance). An initial visualisation model was then constructed with Dr Jin Gao, Lecturer in Digital Archives, and Dr Bonnie Buyuklieva, Lecturer in Data Science for Society, both from the Department of Information Studies at University College London. This way of mapping information links the subject further to its conceptual framework on global nodal connectivity and offers a new way of reading art history.

The first prototype of the data-visualization model addresses the period from the 1960s to the ‘80s, when CAS was active. This model reveals the key geographical locations in the UK where international exchange was taking place during this period. It also highlights the types of practice that artists were focusing on and features the individuals that created the global networks. Beyond this, the model allows us to track the development of artistic networks in the UK. This data-based reading of digital art provides an alternative context to the traditional art historical canon that presents artists as individual geniuses and encourages one to recognize instead the interdependencies of artistic practices. Moreover, it is an interactive data-visualization model, making art history a more tactile matter. The next step in this model is to chart the relationships between practitioners of early generations to artists of the 1990s to the 2020s. A continued enquiry of this type into the present might help to show connections between the period of computational art which is covered here and the contemporary period that this project is yet to map. 

This research project was developed between January 2023 and June 2024 at the V&A with the support of the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art.
