                    <strong>Pita Arreola:</strong> Reflecting on the beginning
                    of your career, could you elaborate on your earliest
                    encounters with computer art and how you came to incorporate
                    certain methodologies and technologies into your practice?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Analivia Cordeiro:</strong> When I presented my work
                    <em>M3x3</em> in 1973, I was only 19 years old. I did not
                    have any formal training or academic links to the field of
                    technology. I learned how to program computers through
                    books. More importantly, I was a professional dancer. I have
                    been dancing since I was seven years old. This has given me
                    a complex understanding of the vocabulary and language of
                    body movements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1973, my life radically changed when my father, the
                    artist Waldemar Cordeiro, passed away unexpectedly in his
                    sleep at the age of 48. But I continued my work and in
                    August that year, I premiered <em>M3x3</em> at the
                    âINTERACT. Man: Machine: Societyâ* exhibition and conference
                    which was part of the Edinburgh International Festival. I
                    did not attend the event, but I sent the film by post with
                    the paper 'A Language for Danceâ (1973) which is part of the
                    V&amp;A collection. The architect John Lansdown presented
                    the paper and the film on my behalf at the conference.

                  <p>
                    During 1974, I was invited to be part of a seminar for the
                    Art and Science programme at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and
                    Design in Jerusalem which was organized by the cybernetician
                    and computer artist Vladimir BonaÄiÄ. It was an interesting
                    experience because I was by far the youngest person
                    attending. I met the artist John Whitney who was 72 at that
                    time and became friends with the artist Herbert Franke. His
                    English was not good and mine was worse, but we developed a
                    nice friendship. When I came back to Brazil, we exchanged
                    letters, and communicating by post took months of course.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I also had a very good relationship with the cybernetician
                    Gordon Pask. He was a very intelligent person with a
                    flexible mind. I had dinner at his house, and we talked
                    about education. I only met John Lansdown once and we did
                    not have the time to discuss culture, but in 1977 he wrote a
                    paper about computers and choreography, and he mentioned my
                    practice as an example of pioneering work.**
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>PA:</strong> Since early on in your career, you have
                    taken part in different events and exhibitions such as
                    âINTERACT. Machine: Man: Societyâ (1973), organized by the
                    Computer Arts Society (CAS) for the Edinburgh International
                    Festival; the âLatin America 74â exhibition at the Institute
                    of Contemporary Art (ICA), London (1973); and the âArt and
                    Scienceâ programme at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and
                    Design, Jerusalem (1974). Could you tell us about these and
                    other events that were both memorable and important in
                    establishing the circle that your practice originates from,
                    or that further raised the profile of your community of
                    practice?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>AC:</strong> I was somewhat isolated in Brazil. I
                    had little money after my fatherâs death, so I couldnât
                    travel much. I travelled intellectually, but not physically.
                    But in a way, I had many freedoms in my work because I was
                    not connected to a university or company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Those exhibitions, especially âINTERACT. Machine: Man:
                    Societyâ<em>,</em> were fundamental for my career. I was
                    very young when I sent my proposal to CAS, but they accepted
                    it and sent me an invitation to be part of the exhibition by
                    post. I took the letter to the broadcaster TV Cultura in
                    Brazil and asked them for support. The director was
                    astonished that I had received an invitation to present my
                    work at an international arts festival. It took some
                    convincing, but she agreed to speak to the committee and
                    after 10 days they confirmed their support. Without Lansdown
                    and the exhibition, I would have never been able to develop
                    <em>M3x3</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For the recording of this video, a computer generated the
                    instructions to assemble the scenes, so the TV director did
                    not have much work to do. The dancers were aware of how to
                    direct their movements towards the cameras positioned at the
                    front, top and sides of the stage. For the final edition, I
                    asked them to use a high contrast of black and white, so the
                    images could aesthetically respond to computer binaries, 0s
                    and 1s, as well as merge the body with the scene. They were
                    reluctant at first, but they ended up accepting my request.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After that, I met Jorge Glusberg, director of Centro de Arte
                    y ComunicaciÃ³n (CAyC), in Buenos Aires. He selected the work
                    of artists, including mine, and presented it in New York and
                    across Europe in countries like Italy, Belgium and France,
                    and in London at the ICA. These exhibitions raised awareness
                    of the exchanges between art and technology and presented
                    the aesthetic propositions of a collective of artists. CAS
                    and CAyC cemented the foundations of todayâs digital art
                    practices. I was very lucky to be part of those groups.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> Around the period these events took
                    place, the early 1970s, what specific vocabulary was being
                    used to describe digital art? It would be good to hear about
                    that, considering how terminologies have been used and
                    changed across different periods.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>AC:</strong> At the beginning there were two main
                    terms: âcomputer artâ and âcomputer-aided artâ. Computer art
                    applied to works where the output was directly generated by
                    the computer, like a plotter drawing. Computer-aided art
                    described work where the computer produced the instructions
                    for humans to translate and execute. In this type of art
                    form, the final artwork is the human interpretation. Over
                    time, the latter term disappeared; we donât have a
                    distinction any more between computer- and human-decoded
                    outputs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My work also included video, which fell under âmultimedia
                    artâ, a term that came after âcomputer artâ. Gradually, the
                    whole movement evolved into a moment when it was called âart
                    and technologyâ. Nowadays, everybody uses technology. The
                    term âdigitalâ sits in opposition to âanalogueâ, and at this
                    point in time the analogue seems Palaeolithic and has
                    disappeared. âDigital artâ emerges from computer art and
                    should be used to describe artists who are really
                    questioning the relationship between humans and technology.
                    Using digital tools is not enough anymore. We are now
                    immersed in technology and unable to experience reality
                    without technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, our visual capacity changes over time. It
                    relies on the stimuli we receive and our physiology. We see
                    things differently than we used to see them last century.
                    Today, there are two prominent phenomena that contemporary
                    art should address. The first is the constancy of change,
                    and the second is the excessive abundance of visual imagery.
                    In my view, what matters today is not the individual
                    artwork, but the visual structure that it proposes.
                    âGenerative artâ produces thousands of examples of the same
                    visual structure, and each example is a variation of this
                    structure. In this type of work, the audienceâs role shifts
                    from selecting a specific artwork to rationally
                    understanding the visual structure because it is very
                    difficult to choose one image since they all seem similar,
                    but each one is different from the other. The images appear
                    similar but they are never the same.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Digital art is no longer sufficient to address this type of
                    art, and it could be called instead âpost-digital artâ which
                    could also be described as âprobabilisticâ or âstructural
                    digital artâ. Probability here refers to rapid and constant
                    change. This attitude can be defined as a âquantum postureâ,
                    where things are in continuous flux, passing through a
                    position for a fraction of a second and we are only able to
                    perceive and experience their constant change. To create
                    work in this context means that images are constantly being
                    generated and their physical representation is the structure
                    in time. Because of this, time is central to the concept of
                    structural art. Iâm trying to explain here what will be
                    implicit in future works of art that will originate from
                    âcomputer artâ that existed 60 years ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Future spectators will be challenged to understand and
                    visually absorb this structure, but visualisation is
                    changing, and we will change. People will need more accuracy
                    to understand and memorize similar images.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> Over the years, you have collaborated
                    with different individuals across the UK and
                    internationally, including Vladimir BonaÄiÄ, John Lansdown
                    and Nilton Lobo. Could you tell us about these
                    collaborations and the expertise they have brought to your
                    practice?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>AC:</strong> As I mentioned, Lansdown was
                    fundamental: his invitation to âINTERACTâ and the
                    collaboration that generated was what brought me into this
                    world. Before him, I met BonaÄiÄ. He came to Brazil in 1971
                    for the exhibition âArteÃ´nicaâ that my father organized in
                    SÃ£o Paulo. I was then a first-year student at the
                    Architecture and Urbanism College at the University of SÃ£o
                    Paulo. During his visit, I showed him mathematical visual
                    studies that I had done utilizing lines and dots. He then
                    introduced me to the concept of random choice which was
                    shaping the aesthetic of that moment and was very important
                    for programming my work. These ideas helped me consider how
                    to program my choreographies defining the different body
                    positions.

                  <p>
                    I went to New York in 1977 and studied under the dancer and
                    choreographer Merce Cunningham. After that, I came back to
                    Brazil and developed the second phase of my work dedicated
                    to the notation of movement. It is unbelievable but still
                    today there is not an established efficient and easy method
                    to write movements like we have with music. Over the years,
                    dance history has been lost because of this reason. At that
                    point, I was looking for a collaborator and went to the
                    University of SÃ£o Paulo. In January 1983, the director of
                    the Computer Science Department introduced me to the
                    engineer Nilton Lobo. We began our collaboration, and we got
                    married in 1993. We now have a son who is part of our family
                    research unit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first thing that I have to say is that I consider Nilton
                    a co-author, because technical experts not only support the
                    work, but they also shape the work with their perspective.
                    They give the work future possibilities. I believe all
                    artists should consider technicians as co-authors.

                    In the beginning, I had a vision of programming human
                    movement into the computer. The work we have done is
                    pioneering motion capture, as there was nothing available to
                    do this before. To be a pioneer means that you find ways to
                    transform ideas that do not exist into reality. Through our
                    research on trajectory notation, I studied the single frames
                    of a film and identified 24 joints of the bodyâs limbs per
                    frame. The video contained 30 frames per second and this
                    exercise produced thousands of body movements. Nilton made
                    the program that transformed that information into 2D
                    figures that we used to generate 3D computer figures. This
                    whole process resulted in a motion-capture system called
                    Nota-Anna.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> Beyond networks of digital art that
                    weâve mentioned, youâve also circulated amongst communities
                    of dance. Could you tell us about how these differ or what
                    they bring?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>AC:</strong> I have always considered myself a
                    dancer. Dance communities are very distinct from others
                    because we have a strict lifestyle. To be a dancer is like
                    being an athlete. We are very disciplined. We are not able
                    to go out at night and get drunk, because the next morning
                    we cannot work well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>PA:</strong> As a practitioner with expertise in the
                    fields of algorithmic choreography and architecture of
                    movement, could you outline some of the key technologies and
                    tools that have made your practice possible?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>AC:</strong> I mostly use video in my work. At the
                    beginning, I did not have a plotter, so I drew by hand the
                    six numbers of a vector that represent the body position in
                    the printed output of the computer dance. I used plotters
                    when they became available. Then later, the operating system
                    Windows, which I found to be great because you could store
                    different information and it gave you the ability to
                    multitask. The internet changed everything and gave us the
                    opportunity to communicate with more people. When video was
                    integrated into the internet, the space became a paradise.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In terms of software, Photoshop created great freedom and
                    QuickTime allowed the editing process in video to become
                    home-made. These technological tools empowered individuals
                    but people have become slaves to the technology. I am not
                    driven by technology. I use it when it makes sense to me. I
                    have incorporated all the new technologies into my work
                    because it made the research easier and because of the
                    possibilities it opened to develop our first dream of
                    finding a way to write and create movement. Today, the
                    challenge for people is to find a personal space that allows
                    them to express themselves. Technology obliges us to follow
                    too many rules to communicate, we should have more space to
                    find our personal way of communicating.

                    <strong>PA:</strong> It would be interesting to hear about
                    the thinkers and theoretical concepts that have helped shape
                    your work.

                    <strong>AC:</strong> Historically, Brazil was not a
                    technology driven country, but I had my father. When he was
                    alive, he gave me access to information and books about
                    computer art and theorists like the engineer and philosopher
                    Abraham Moles. These ideas provided me with a clear
                    direction to understand technological contexts and my place
                    within them. Another theorist is Jonathan Benthall from the
                    ICA, London, who had a very unique and humanistic
                    perspective about technology and culture. His book
                    <em>Science and Technology in Art Today</em> (1972) was very
                    influential for the field.

                    Additionally, I had a very special education with the
                    choreographer Maria Duschenes under the Rudolf Laban dance
                    method. Laban was a theoretician who analyzed the language
                    of human body movement through its elements and established
                    the relationship between those elements. He was very
                    important to my work, because this method allowed me to
                    understand body movements in order to program them on the
                    computer.

                  <p>
                    Another influential figure was the artist, designer and
                    choreographer Oskar Schlemmer, who was a tutor at the
                    Bauhaus. I love his work. One day, Mrs Duschenes took us to
                    see the film of his <em>Triadic Ballet</em> from 1922 at the
                    Goethe Institut, in SÃ£o Paulo, and I started intuitively
                    learning from his work by dancing and imitating the movement
                    of his dancers. When I was 12, I also met the artist John
                    Cage, and Merce Cunningham. These artistic experiences and
                    my research drove me to seek new aesthetics. I think that a
                    new media requires a new aesthetic. You can see these new
                    languages of video and body movements in my three videos
                    <em>M3x3</em>, <em>0=45Â°</em> (1974)* and
                    <em>Cambiantes</em> (1976).

                    <strong>PA:</strong> Finally, could you speak about the
                    conceptual framework of your work and how it has evolved
                    over the years?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>AC:</strong> The goal of computer art in the 1970s
                    was to establish a dialogue between technology and society.
                    Computers represented a bright future for a new society that
                    would be more egalitarian, with people having more free
                    time. It is not exactly what happened, or is not our reality
                    today, but the energy was very positive. Artists were trying
                    to understand how to translate the language of arts into a
                    computer. In my case, I was looking for ways to translate
                    elements of choreography and body expression so these could
                    be programmed by a computer. Nowadays, we have the opposite
                    problem, we need to take peopleâs activities away from
                    computers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Artists were part of a counter-culture movement and many
                    questions that emerged during that time are still relevant
                    and unresolved today. Counter-culture was very important,
                    and it is something that the group exhibition âCoded: Art
                    Enters the Computer Ageâ (2023) at Los Angeles County Museum
                    of Art showcased very successfully. This movement was killed
                    by big corporations like IBM and Siemens who started to pay
                    artists to create with their products.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At first glance, you can think that I was trying to solve
                    practical problems of how to coordinate the video camera
                    with human movement in dance production. That was one of the
                    objectives of my early research, but the second phase
                    focused on how to write body movements. Behind these
                    practical problems there is deeper research concerning the
                    future of humans and the behaviour of humans with
                    technology. In <em>M3x3</em> I approached this question by
                    establishing body positions through notational figures. The
                    dancers then learnt the positions and created the link
                    between the positions in order to produce the choreography.
                    In this way, the dancers were emotionally involved by making
                    individual decisions on the movements and could express
                    themselves creating the transitions between positions. I
                    never saw the dancer in this process as an animation or an
                    avatar.

                    For example, today you must fit all your messages inside the
                    rectangular shape of screens, otherwise you lose them. This
                    is a big limitation for our brain. If I owned a technology
                    company, I would invent and distribute screens in round,
                    square and polygonal shapes, so people could be freer to
                    feed their ideas to the screen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another element that is important to my work is spontaneity:
                    I always propose to people to act as they feel in their own
                    time, which gives them the freedom to find their own
                    possibilities. This idea was presented in my show âFrom Body
                    to Codeâ (2023) at ZKM (Center for Art and Media, Karlsruhe)
                    where we had motion-capture works that proposed to people
                    ways to find their own pace and movements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A final element of my work is the relationship between
                    humans and their surroundings. In my first work
                    <em>M3x3</em>, I merged the human body with the scene as a
                    way to signify that we are one with nature. This is an idea
                    that I applied to succeeding artworks. Through my work, I
                    invite the audience not to oppose the environment but to
                    work with it. Some people destroy the environment for
                    profit, but there is a limit to what money can provide if we
                    donât have a proper natural world.
